<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>It is the fashion to call every story controversial that deals
with times when controversy or a war of religion was raging; but it
should be remembered that there are some which only attempt to
portray human feelings as affected by the events that such warfare
occasioned.&nbsp; 'Old Mortality' and 'Woodstock' are not
controversial tales, and the 'Chaplet of Pearls' is so quite as
little.&nbsp; It only aims at drawing certain scenes and certain
characters as the convulsions of the sixteenth century may have
affected them, and is, in fact, like all historical romance, the
shaping of the conceptions that the imagination must necessarily
form when dwelling upon the records of history.&nbsp; That faculty
which might be called the passive fancy, and might almost be
described in Portia's song, --</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is engendered in the eyes, By READING
fed - and there it dies,'--</p>

<p>that faculty, I say, has learnt to feed upon character and
incident, and to require that the latter should be effective and
exciting.&nbsp; Is it not reasonable to seek for this in the days
when such things were not infrequent, and did not imply exceptional
wickedness or misfortune in those engaged in them?&nbsp; This seems
to me one plea for historical novel, to which I would add the
opportunity that it gives for study of the times and delineation of
characters.&nbsp; Shakespeare's Henry IV. and Henry V., Scott's
Louis XI., Manzoni's Federigo Borromeo, Bulwer's Harold, James's
Philip Augustus, are all real contributions to our comprehension of
the men themselves, by calling the chronicles and memoirs into
action.&nbsp; True, the picture cannot be exact, and is sometimes
distorted--nay, sometimes praiseworthy efforts at correctness in
the detail take away whatever might have been lifelike in the
outline.&nbsp; Yet, acknowledging all this, I must still plead for
the tales that presumptuously deal with days gone by, as enabling
the young to realize history vividly--and, what is still more
desirable, requiring an effort of the mind which to read of modern
days does not.&nbsp; The details of Millais' Inquisition or of his
Huguenot may be in error in spite of all his study and diligence,
but they have brought before us for ever the horrors of the <i>
auto-da-fe</i>, and the patient, steadfast heroism of the man who
can smile aside his wife's endeavour to make him tacitly betray his
faith to save his life.&nbsp; Surely it is well, by pen as by
picture, to go back to the past for figures that will stir the
heart like these, even though the details be as incorrect as those
of the revolt of Liege or of La Ferrette in 'Quentin Durward' and
'Anne of Geierstein.'</p>

<p>Scott, however, wilfully carved history to suit the purposes of
his story; and in these days we have come to feel that a story must
earn a certain amount of credibility by being in keeping with
established facts, even if striking events have to be sacrificed,
and that the order of time must be preserved.&nbsp; In
Shakespeare's days, or even in Scott's, it might have been possible
to bring Henry III. and his <i>mignons</i> to due punishment within
the limits of a tale beginning with the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew; but in 1868 the broad outlines of tragedy must be
given up to keep within the bounds of historical verity.</p>

<p>How far this has been done, critics better read than myself must
decide.&nbsp; I have endeavoured to speak fairly, to the best of my
ability, of such classes of persons as fell in with the course of
the narrative, according to such lights as the memoirs of the time
afford.&nbsp; The Convent is scarcely a CLASS portrait, but the
condition of it seems to be justified by hints in the Port Royal
memoirs, respecting Maubuisson and others which Mere Angelique
reformed.&nbsp; The intolerance of the ladies at Montauban is
described in Madame Duplessis-Mornay's life; and if Berenger's
education and opinions are looked on as not sufficiently alien from
Roman Catholicism, a reference to Froude's 'History of Queen
Elizabeth' will show both that the customs of the country clergy,
and likewise that a broad distinction was made by the better
informed among the French between Calvinism and Protestantism or
Lutheranism, in which they included Anglicanism.&nbsp; The minister
Gardon I do not consider as representing his class.&nbsp; He is a
POSSIBILITY modified to serve the purposes of the story.</p>

<p>Into historical matters, however, I have only entered so far as
my story became involved with them.&nbsp; And here I have to
apologize for a few blunders, detected too late for alteration even
in the volumes.&nbsp; Sir Francis Walsingham was a young rising
statesman in 1572, instead of the elderly sage he is represented;
his daughter Frances was a mere infant, and Sir Philip Sidney was
not knighted till much later.&nbsp; For the rest, I have tried to
show the scenes that shaped themselves before me as carefully as I
could; though of course they must not be a presentiment of the
times themselves, but of my notion of them.</p>

<h1>THE CHAPLET OF PEARLS</h1>

<h1>or</h1>

<h1>THE WHITE AND BLACK RIBAUMONT</h1>

<h3>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; THE BRIDAL OF THE WHITE AND BLACK</h3>

<p>Small was the ring, and small in truth the finger:</p>

<p>What then?&nbsp; the faith was large that dropped it down.</p>

<p>Aubrey De Vere, INFANT BRIDAL</p>

<p>Setting aside the consideration of the risk, the baby-weddings
of the Middle Ages must have been very pretty sights.</p>

<p>So the Court of France thought the bridal of Henri Beranger
Eustache de Ribaumont and of Marie Eustacie Rosalie de Ribaumont du
Nid-de-Merle, when, amid the festivals that accompanied the
signature of the treaty of Cateau-Cabresis, good-natured King Henri
II. presided merrily at the union of the little pair, whose unite
ages did not reach ten years.</p>

<p>There they stood under the portal of Notre-Dame, the little
bridegroom in a white velvet coat, with puffed sleeves, slashed
with scarlet satin, as were the short, also puffed breeches meeting
his long white knitted silk stockings some way above the knee;
large scarlet rosettes were in his white shoes, a scarlet knot
adorned his little sword, and his velvet cap of the same colour
bore a long white plume, and was encircled by a row of pearls of
priceless value.&nbsp; They are no other than that garland of
pearls which, after a night of personal combat before the walls of
Calais, Edward III. of England took from his helmet and presented
to Sir Eustache de Ribaumont, a knight of Picardy, bidding him say
everywhere that it was a gift from the King of England to the
bravest of knights.</p>

<p>The precious heirlooms were scarcely held with the respect due
to an ornament so acquired.&nbsp; The manly garb for the first time
assumed by his sturdy legs, and the possession of the little sword,
were evidently the most interesting parts of the affair to the
youthful husband, who seemed to find in them his only solace for
the weary length of the ceremony.&nbsp; He was a fine, handsome
little fellow, fair and rosy, with bright blue eyes, and hair like
shining flax, unusually tall and strong-limbed for his age; and as
he gave his hand to his little bride, and walked with her under a
canopy up to kneel at the High Altar, for the marriage blessing and
the mass, they looked like a full-grown couple seen through a
diminishing-glass.</p>

<p>The little bride was perhaps a less beautiful child, but she had
a splendid pair of black eyes, and a sweet little mouth, both set
into the uncomprehending solemnity of baby gravity and contentment
in fine clothes.&nbsp; In accordance with the vow indicated by her
name of Marie, her dress was white and blue, turquoise
forget-me-nots bound the little lace veil on her dark chestnut
hair, the bosom of her white satin dress was sprinkled with the
same azure jewel, and turquoises bordered every seam of the
sweeping skirt with a train befitting a count's daughter, and
meandered in gorgeous constellations round the hem.&nbsp; The
little thing lisped her own vows forth without much notion of their
sense, and indeed was sometimes prompted by her bridesmaid cousin,
a pretty little girl a year older, who thrust in her assistance so
glibly that the King, as well as others of the spectators, laughed,
and observed that she would get herself married to the boy instead
of her cousin.</p>

<p>There was, however, to be no doubt nor mistake about Beranger
and Eustacie de Ribaumont being man and wife.&nbsp; Every ceremony,
religious or domestic, that could render a marriage valid, was gone
through with real earnestness, although with infinite gaiety, on
the part of the court.&nbsp; Much depended on their union, and the
reconcilement of the two branches of the family had long been a
favourite scheme of King Henri II.</p>

<p>Both alike were descended from Anselme de Ribaumont, renowned in
the first Crusade, and from the brave Picard who had received the
pearls; but, in the miserable anarchy of Charles VI.'s reign, the
elder brother had been on the Burgundian side--like most of the
other nobles of Picardy--and had thus been brought into the English
camp, where, regarding Henry V. as lawfully appointed to the
succession, and much admiring him and his brother Nedford, he had
become an ardent supporter of the English claim.&nbsp; He had
married an English lady, and had received the grant if the castle
of Leurre in Normandy by way of compensation for his ancestral one
of Ribaumont in Picardy, which had been declared to be forfeited by
his treason, and seized by his brother.</p>

<p>This brother had always been an Armagnac, and had risen and
thriven with his party,--before the final peace between France and
England obliged the elder line to submit to Charles VII.&nbsp;
Since that time there had been a perpetual contention as to the
restitution of Chateau Ribaumont, a strife which under Louis XI.
had become an endless lawsuit; and in the days of duelling had
occasioned a good many insults and private encounters.&nbsp; The
younger branch, or Black Ribaumonts, had received a grant from
Louis XI. of the lands of Nid-de-Merle, belonging to an unfortunate
Angevin noble, who had fallen under the royal displeasure, and they
had enjoyed court favour up to the present generation, when Henri
II., either from opposition to his father, instinct for honesty, or
both, had become a warm friend to the gay and brilliant young Baron
de Ribaumont, head of the white or elder branch of the family.</p>

<p>The family contention seemed likely to wear out of its own
accord, for the Count de Ribaumont was an elderly and childless
man, and his brother, the Chevalier de Ribaumont, was, according to
the usual lot of French juniors, a bachelor, so that it was
expected that the whole inheritance would centre upon the elder
family.&nbsp; However, to the general surprise, the Chevalier late
in life married, and became the father of a son and daughter; but
soon after calculations were still more thrown out by the birth of
a little daughter in the old age of the Count.</p>

<p>Almost from the hour in which her sex was announced, the King
had promised the Baron de Ribaumont that she should be the wife of
his young son, and that all the possessions of the house should be
settled upon the little couple, engaging to provide for the
Chevalier's disappointed heir in some commandery of a religious
order of knighthood.</p>

<p>The Baron's wife was English.&nbsp; He had, when on a visit to
his English kindred, entirely turned the head of the lovely Annora
Walwyn, and finding that her father, one of the gravest of Tudor
statesmen, would not hear of her breaking her engagement to the
honest Dorset squire Marmaduke Thistlewood, he had carried her off
by a stolen marriage and <i>coup de main</i>, which, as her beauty,
rank, and inheritance were all considerable, had won him great
reputation at the gay court of Henri II.</p>

<p>Infants as the boy and girl were, the King had hurried on their
marriage to secure its taking place in the lifetime of the
Count.&nbsp; The Countess had died soon after the birth of the
little girl, and if the arrangement were to take effect at all, it
must be before she should fall under the guardianship of her uncle,
the Chevalier.&nbsp; Therefore the King had caused her to be
brought up from the cottage in Anjou, where she had been nursed,
and in person superintended the brilliant wedding.&nbsp; He himself
led off the dance with the tiny bride, conducting her through its
mazes with fatherly kindliness and condescension; but Queen
Catherine, who was strongly in the interests of the Angevin branch,
and had always detested the Baron as her husband's intimate,
excused herself from dancing with the bridegroom.&nbsp; He
therefore fell to the share of the Dauphiness Queen of Scots, a
lovely, bright-eyed, laughing girl, who so completely fascinated
the little fellow, that he convulsed the court by observing that he
should not have objected to be married to some one like her,
instead of a little baby like Eustacie.</p>

<p>Amid all the mirth, it was not only the Chevalier and the Queen
who bore displeased looks.&nbsp; In truth, both were too great
adepts in court life to let their dissatisfaction appear.&nbsp; The
gloomiest face was that of him whose triumph it was--the
bridegroom's father, the Baron de Ribaumont.&nbsp; He had suffered
severely from the sickness that prevailed in St. Quentin, when in
the last August the Admiral de Coligny had been besieged there by
the Spaniards, and all agreed that he had never been the same man
since, either in health or in demeanour.&nbsp; When he came back
from his captivity and found the King bent on crowning his return
by the marriage of the children, he had hung back, spoken of
scruples about such unconscious vows, and had finally only
consented under stress of the personal friendship of the King, and
on condition that he and his wife should at once have the sole
custody of the little bride.&nbsp; Even then he moved about the gay
scene with so distressed and morose an air that he was evidently
either under the influence of a scruple of conscience or of a
foreboding of evil.</p>

<p>No one doubted that it had been the latter, when, three days
later, Henri II., in the prime of his strength and height of his
spirits, encountered young Des Lorges in the lists, received the
splinter of a lance in his eye, and died two days afterwards.</p>

<p>No sooner were his obsequies over than the Baron de Ribaumont
set off with his wife and the little bridal pair for his castle of
Leurre, in Normandy, nor was he ever seen at court again.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; THE SEPARATION</h3>

<p>Parted without the least regret,</p>

<p>Except that they had ever met.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>

<p>Misses, the tale that I relate,</p>

<p>This lesson seems to carry:</p>

<p>Choose not alone a proper mate,</p>

<p>But proper time to marry!</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
COWPER, PAIRING TIME ANTICIPATED</p>

<p>'I will have it!'</p>

<p>'Thou shalt not have it!'</p>

<p>'Diane says it is mine.'</p>

<p>'Diane knows nothing about it.'</p>

<p>'Gentlemen always yield to ladies.'</p>

<p>'Wives ought to mind their husbands.'</p>

<p>'Then I will not be thy wife.'</p>

<p>'Thou canst not help it.'</p>

<p>'I will.&nbsp; I will tell my father what M. le Baron reads and
sings, and then I know he will.'</p>

<p>'And welcome.'</p>

<p>Eustacie put out her lip, and began to cry.</p>

<p>The 'husband and wife,' now eight and seven years old, were in a
large room hung with tapestry, representing the history of
Tobit.&nbsp; A great state bed, curtained with piled velvet, stood
on a sort of <i>dais</i> at the further end; there was a
toilet-table adorned with curiously shaped boxes, and coloured
Venetian glasses, and filigree pouncet-boxes, and with a small
mirror whose frame was inlaid with gold and ivory.&nbsp; A large
coffer, likewise inlaid, stood against the wall, and near it a
cabinet, of Dutch workmanship, a combination of ebony, ivory, wood,
and looking-glass, the centre retreating, and so arranged that by
the help of most ingenious attention to perspective and reflection,
it appeared like the entrance to a magnificent miniature
cinque-cento palace, with steps up to a vestibule paved in black
and white lozenges, and with three endless corridors diverging from
it.&nbsp; So much for show; for use, this palace was a bewildering
complication of secret drawers and pigeon-holes, all depending
indeed upon one tiny gold key; but unless the use of that key were
well understood, all it led to was certain outer receptacles of
fragrant Spanish gloves, knots of ribbon, and kerchiefs strewn over
with rose leaves and lavender.&nbsp; However, Eustacie had secured
the key, and was now far beyond these mere superficial
matters.&nbsp; Her youthful lord had just discovered her mounted on
a chair, her small person decked out with a profusion of necklaces,
jewels, bracelets, chains, and rings; and her fingers, as well as
they could under their stiffening load, were opening the very
penetralia of the cabinet, the inner chamber of the hall, where lay
a case adorned with the Ribaumont arms and containing the far-famed
chaplet of pearls.&nbsp; It was almost beyond her reach, but she
had risen on tip-toe, and was stretching out her hand for it, when
he, springing behind her on the chair, availed himself of his
superior height and strength to shut the door of this Arcanum and
turn the key.&nbsp; His mortifying permission to his wife to absent
herself arose from pure love of teasing, but the next moment he
added, still holding his hand on the key--'As to telling what my
father reads, that would be treason.&nbsp; How shouldst thou know
what it is?'</p>

<p>'Does thou think every one is an infant but thyself?'</p>

<p>'But who told thee that to talk of my father's books would get
him into trouble?' continued the boy, as they still stood together
on the high heavy wooden chair.</p>

<p>She tossed her pretty head, and pretended to pout.</p>

<p>'Was it Diane? I will know.&nbsp; Didst thou tell Diane?'</p>

<p>Instead of answering, now that his attention to the key was
relaxed, Eustacie made a sudden dart, like a little wild cat, at
the back of the chair and at the key.&nbsp; They chair
over-balanced;</p>

<p>Beranger caught at the front drawer of the cabinet, which,
unlocked by Eustacie, came out in his hand, and chair, children,
drawer, and curiosities all went rolling over together on the floor
with a hubbub that brought all the household together, exclaiming
and scolding.&nbsp; Madame de Ribaumont's displeasure at the
rifling of her hoards knew no bounds; Eustacie, by way of defence,
shrieked 'like twenty demons;' Beranger, too honourable to accuse
her, underwent the same tempest; and at last both were soundly
rapped over the knuckles with the long handle of Madame's fan, and
consigned to two separate closets, to be dealt with on the return
of M. le Baron, while Madame returned to her embroidery, lamenting
the absence of that dear little Diane, whose late visit at the
chateau had been marked by such unusual tranquillity between the
children.</p>

<p>Beranger, in his dark closet, comforted himself with the shrewd
suspicion that his father was so employed as not to be expected at
home till supper-time, and that his mother's wrath was by no means
likely to be so enduring as to lead her to make complaints of the
prisoners; and when he heard a trampling of horses in the court, he
anticipated a speedy release and summons to show himself to the
visitors.&nbsp; He waited long, however, before he heard the
pattering of little feet; then a stool scraped along the floor, the
button of his door was undone, the stool pushed back, and as he
emerged, Eustacie stood before him with her finger to her
lip.&nbsp; '<i>Chut</i>, Beranger! It is my father and uncle, and
Narcisse, and, oh! so many <i>gens d'armes</i>.&nbsp; They are come
to summon M. le Baron to go with them to disperse the <i>preche</i>
by the Bac de l'Oie.&nbsp; And oh, Beranger, is he not there?'</p>

<p>'I do not know.&nbsp; He went out with his hawk, and I do not
think he could have gone anywhere else.&nbsp; Did they say so to my
mother?'</p>

<p>'Yes; but she never knows.&nbsp; And oh, Beranger, Narcisse told
me--ah, was it to tease me?--that Diane has told them all they
wanted to know, for that they sent her here on purpose to see if we
were not all Huguenots.</p>

<p>'Very likely, the little viper! Le me pass, Eustacie.&nbsp; I
must go and tell my father.'</p>

<p>'Thou canst not get out that way; the court is full of
men-at-arms.&nbsp; Hark, there's Narcisse calling me.&nbsp; He will
come after me.'</p>

<p>There was not a moment to lose.&nbsp; Berenger flew along a
corridor, and down a narrow winding stair, and across the kitchen;
then snatching at the arm of a boy of his own age whom he met at
the door, he gasped out, 'Come and help me catch Follet, Landry!'
and still running across an orchard, he pulled down a couple of
apples from the trees, and bounded into a paddock where a small
rough Breton pony was feeding among the little tawny Norman
cows.&nbsp; The animal knew his little master, and trotted towards
him at his call of 'Follet, Follet.&nbsp; Now be a wise Follet, and
play me no tricks.&nbsp; Thou and I, Follet, shall do good service,
if thou wilt be steady.'</p>

<p>Follet made his advances, but with a coquettish eye and look, as
if ready to start away at any moment.</p>

<p>'Soh, Follet.&nbsp; I have no bread for thee, only two apples;
but, Follet, listen.&nbsp; There's my <i>beau-pere</i> the Count,
and the Chevalier, all spite, and their whole troop of savage <i>
gens d'armes,</i> come out to fall upon the poor Huguenots, who are
doing no harm at all, only listening to a long dull sermon.&nbsp;
And I am much afraid my father is there, for he went out his hawk
on his wrist, and he never does take Ysonde for any real sport, as
thou and I would do, Follet.&nbsp; He says it is all vanity of
vanities.&nbsp; But thou know'st, if they caught him at the <i>
preche</i> they would call it heresy and treason, and all sorts of
horrors, and any way they would fall like demons on the poor
Huguenots, Jacques and all -- thine own Jacques, Follet.&nbsp;
Come, be a loyal pony, Follet.&nbsp; Be at least as good as
Eustacie.'</p>

<p>Follet was evidently attentive to this peroration, turning round
his ear in a sensible attitude, and advancing his nose to the
apples.&nbsp; As Beranger held them out to him, the other boy
clutched his shaggy forelock so effectually that the start back did
not shake him off, and the next moment Beranger was on his
back.</p>

<p>'And I, Monsieur, what shall I do?'</p>

<p>'Thou, Landry?&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; Speed like a hare, lock the
avenue gate, and hide the key.&nbsp; That will delay them a long
time.&nbsp; Off now, Follet.'</p>

<p>Beranger and Follet understood one another far too well to care
about such trifles as saddle and bridle, and off they went through
green grassy balks dividing the fields, or across the stubble,
till, about three miles from the castle, they came to a narrow
valley, dipping so suddenly between the hills that it could hardly
have been suspected by one unaware of its locality, and the sides
were dotted with copsewood, which entirely hid the bottom.&nbsp;
Beranger guided his pony to a winding path that led down the steep
side of the valley, already hearing the cadence of a loud, chanting
voice, throwing out its sounds over the assembly, whence arose
assenting hums over an undercurrent of sobs, as though the
excitable French assembly were strongly affected.</p>

<p>The thicket was so close that Beranger was almost among the
congregation before he could see more than a passing glimpse of a
sea of heads.&nbsp; Stout, ruddy, Norman peasants, and high
white-capped women, mingled with a few soberly-clad townsfolk,
almost all with the grave, steadfast cast of countenance imparted
by unresisted persecution, stood gathered round the green mound
that served as a natural pulpit for a Calvinist minister, who more
the dress of a burgher, but entirely black.&nbsp; To Beranger's
despair, he was in the act of inviting his hearers to join with him
in singing one of Marot's psalms; and the boy, eager to lose not a
moment, grasped the skirt of the outermost of the crowd.&nbsp; The
man, an absorbed-looking stranger, merely said, 'Importune me not,
child.'</p>

<p>'Listen!' said Beranger; 'it imports---'</p>

<p>'Peace,' was the stern answer; but a Norman farmer looked round
at that moment, and Beranger exclaimed, 'Stop the singing!&nbsp;
The <i>gens d'armes</i>!' The psalm broke off; the whisper
circulated; the words 'from Leurre' were next conveyed from lip to
lip, and, as it were in a moment, the dense human mass had broken
up and vanished, stealing through the numerous paths in the
brushwood, or along the brook, as it descended through tall sedges
and bulrushes.&nbsp; The valley was soon as lonely as it had been
populous; the pulpit remained a mere mossy bank, more suggestive or
fairy dances than of Calvinist sermons, and no one remained on the
scene save Beranger with his pony, Jacques the groom, a stout
farmer, the preacher, and a tall thin figure in the plainest dark
cloth dress that could be worn by a gentleman, a hawk on his
wrist.</p>

<p>'Thou here, my boy!' he exclaimed, as Beranger came to his side;
and as the little fellow replied in a few brief words, he took him
by the hand, and said to the minister, 'Good Master Isaac, let me
present my young son to you, who under Heaven hath been the means
of saving many lives this day.'</p>

<p>Maitre Isaac Gardon, a noted preacher, looked kindly at the
boy's fair face, and said, 'Bless thee, young sir.&nbsp; As thou
hast been already a chosen instrument to save life, so mayest thou
be ever after a champion of the truth.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur le Baron,' interposed Jacques, 'it were best to look
to yourself.&nbsp; I already hear sounds upon the wind.'</p>

<p>'And you, good sir?' said the Baron.</p>

<p>'I will see to him,' said the farmer, grasping him as a sort of
property.&nbsp; 'M. le Baron had best keep up the beck.&nbsp; Out
on the moor there he may fly the hawk, and that will best divert
suspicion.'</p>

<p>'Farewell, then,' said the Baron, wringing the minister's hand,
and adding, almost to himself, 'Alas! I am weary of these shifts!'
and weary indeed he seemed, for as the ground became so steep that
the beck danced noisily down its channel, he could not keep up the
needful speed, but paused, gasping for breath, with his hand on his
side.&nbsp; 'Beranger was off his pony in an instant, assuring
Follet that it ought to be proud to be ridden by his father, and
exhaling his own exultant feelings in caresses to the animal as it
gallantly breasted the hill.&nbsp; The little boy had never been so
commended before!&nbsp; He loved his father exceedingly; but the
Baron, while ever just towards him, was grave and strict to a
degree that the ideas even of the sixteenth century regarded as
severe.&nbsp; Little Eustacie with her lovely face, her
irrepressible saucy grace and audacious coaxing, was the only
creature to whom he ever showed much indulgence and tenderness, and
even that seemed almost against his will and conscience.&nbsp; His
son was always under rule, often blamed, and scarcely ever praised;
but it was a hardy vigorous nature, and respectful love throve
under the system that would have crushed or alienated a different
disposition.&nbsp; It was not till the party had emerged from the
wood upon a stubble field, where a covey of partridges flew up, and
to Beranger's rapturous delight furnished a victim for Ysonde, that
M. de Ribaumont dismounted from the pony, and walking towards home,
called his son to his side, and asked him how he had learnt the
intentions of the Count and the Chevalier.&nbsp; Beranger explained
how Eustacie had come to warn him, and also told what she had said
of Diane de Ribaumont, who had lately, by her father's request,
spent a few weeks at the chateau with her cousins.</p>

<p>'My son,' said the Baron, 'it is hard to ask of babes caution
and secrecy; but I must know from thee what thy cousin may have
heard of our doings?'</p>

<p>'I cannot tell, father,' replied Beranger; 'we played more than
we talked.&nbsp; Yet, Monsieur, you will not be angry with Eustacie
if I tell you what she said to me to-day?'</p>

<p>'Assuredly not, my son.'</p>

<p>'She said that her father would take her away if he knew what M.
le Baron read, and what he sung.'</p>

<p>'Thou hast done well to tell me, my son.&nbsp; Thinkest thou
that this comes from Diane, or from one of the servants?'</p>

<p>'Oh, from Diane, my father; none of the servants would dare to
say such a thing.'</p>

<p>'It is as I suspected then,' said the Baron. 'That child was
sent amongst us as a spy.'&nbsp; Tell me, Beranger, had she any
knowledge of our intended journey to England?'</p>

<p>'To England!&nbsp; But no, father, I did not even know it was
intended.&nbsp; To England--to that Walwyn which my mother takes
such pains to make us speak rightly.&nbsp; Are we then, going?'</p>

<p>'Listen, my son.&nbsp; Thou hast to-day proved thyself worthy of
trust, and thou shalt hear.&nbsp; My son, ere yet I knew the truth
I was a reckless disobedient youth, and I bore thy mother from her
parents in England without their consent.&nbsp; Since, by Heaven's
grace, I have come to a better mind, we have asked and obtained
their forgiveness, and it has long been their desire to see again
their daughter and her son.&nbsp; Moreover, since the accession of
the present Queen, it has been a land where the light is free to
shine forth; and though I verily believe what Maitre Gardon says,
that persecution is a blessed means of grace, yet it is grievous to
expose one's dearest thereto when they are in no state to count the
cost. Therefore would I thither convey you all, and there amid thy
mother's family would we openly abjure the errors in which we have
been nurture. I have already sent to Paris to obtain from the
Queen-mother the necessary permission to take my family to visit
thy grand-father, and it must now be our endeavour to start
immediately on the receipt of the reply, before the Chevalier's
information can lead to any hindrance or detention of
Eustacie.'</p>

<p>'Then Eustacie will go with us, Monsieur?'</p>

<p>'Certainly.&nbsp; Nothing is more important than that her faith
should be the same as yours!&nbsp; But discretion, my son: not a
word to the little one.'</p>

<p>'And Landry, father?&nbsp; I had rather Landry went than
Eustacie.&nbsp; And Follet, dear father, pray take him.'</p>

<p>After M. de Ribaumont's grave confidence to his son and heir, he
was a little scandalized at the comparative value that the boy's
voice indicated for wife, foster-brother, and pony, and therefore
received it in perfect silence, which silence continued until they
reached the chateau, where the lady met them at the door with a
burst of exclamations.</p>

<p>'Ah, there you are, safe, my dear Baron. I have been in
despair.&nbsp; Here were the Count and his brother come to call on
you to join them in dispersing a meeting of those poor Huguenots
and they would not permit me to send out to call you in!&nbsp; I
verily think they suspected that you were aware of it.'</p>

<p>M. de Ribaumont made no answer, but sat wearily down and asked
for his little Eustacie.</p>

<p>'Little vixen!' exclaimed the Baroness, 'she is gone; her father
took her away with him.'&nbsp; And as her husband looked extremely
displeased, she added that Eustacie had been meddling with her
jewel cabinet and had been put in penitence. Her first impulse on
seeing her father had been to cling to him and poor out her
complaints, whereupon he had declared that he should take her away
with him at once, and had in effect caused her pony to be saddled,
and he had ridden away with her to his old tower, leaving his
brother, the Chevalier, to conduct the attack on the Huguenot
conventicle.</p>

<p>'He had no power or right to remove her,' said the Baron.&nbsp;
'How could you let him do so in my absence?&nbsp; He had made over
her wardship to me, and has no right to resume it!'</p>

<p>'Well, perhaps I might have insisted on his waiting till your
return; but, you see, the children have never done anything but
quarrel and fight, and always by Eustacie's fault; and if ever they
are to endure each other, it must be by being separated now.'</p>

<p>'Madame,' said the Baron, gravely, 'you have done your utmost to
ruin your son's chances of happiness.'</p>

<p>That same evening arrived the King's passport permitting the
Baron de Ribaumont and his family to pay a visit to his wife's
friends in England. The next morning the Baron was summoned to
speak to one of his farmers, a Huguenot, who had come to inform him
that, through the network of intelligence kept up by the members of
the persecuted faith, it had become known that the Chevalier de
Ribaumont had set off for court that night, and there was little
doubt that his interference would lead to an immediate revocation
of the sanction to the journey, if to no severer measures.&nbsp; At
best, the Baron knew that if his own absence were permitted, it
would be only on condition of leaving his son in the custody of
either the Queen-mother or the Count.&nbsp; It had become
impossible to reclaim Eustacie.&nbsp; Her father would at once have
pleaded that she was being bred up in Huguenot errors.&nbsp; All
that could be done was to hasten the departure ere the royal
mandate could arrive.&nbsp; A little Norman sailing vessel was
moored two evenings after in a lonely creek on the coast, and into
it stepped M. de Ribaumont, with his Bible, Marot's Psalter, and
Calvin's works, Beranger still tenderly kissing a lock of Follet's
mane, and Madame mourning for the pearls, which her husband deemed
too sacred an heirloom to carry away to a foreign land.&nbsp; Poor
little Eustacie, with her cousin Diane, was in the convent of
Bellaise in Anjou.&nbsp; If any one lamented her absence, it was
her father-in-law.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; THE FAMILY COUNCIL</h3>

<p>He counsels a divorce</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakespeare, KING HENRY VIII.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year 1572, a family council was assembled
in Hurst Walwyn Hall.&nbsp; The scene was a wainscoted oriel
chamber closed off by a screen from the great hall, and fitted on
two sides by presses of books, surmounted the one by a terrestrial,
the other by a celestial globe, the first 'with the addition of the
Indies' in very eccentric geography, the second with enormous stars
studding highly grotesque figures, regarded with great awe by most
beholders.</p>

<p>A solid oaken table stood in the midst, laden with books and
papers, and in a corner, near the open hearth, a carved desk,
bearing on one slope the largest copy of the 'Bishops' Bible'; on
the other, one of the Prayer-book.&nbsp; The ornaments of the oaken
mantelpiece culminated in a shield bearing a cross <i>
boutonnee</i>, i.e. with trefoil terminations.&nbsp; It was
supported between a merman with a whelk shell and a mermaid with a
comb, and another like Siren curled her tail on the top of the
gaping baronial helmet above the shield, while two more upheld the
main weight of the chimney-piece on either side of the glowing
wood-fire.</p>

<p>In the seat of honour was an old gentleman, white-haired, and
feeble of limb, but with noble features and a keen, acute
eye.&nbsp; This was Sir William, Baron of Hurst Walwyn, a valiant
knight at Guingate and Boulogne, a statesman of whom Wolsey had
been jealous, and a ripe scholar who had shared the friendship of
More and Erasmus.&nbsp; The lady who sat opposite to him was
several years younger, still upright, brisk and active, though her
hair was milk-white; but her eyes were of undimmed azure, and her
complexion still retained a beauteous pink and white.&nbsp; She was
highly educated, and had been the friend of Margaret Roper and her
sisters, often sharing their walks in the bright Chelsea
garden.&nbsp; Indeed, the musk-rose in her own favourite nook at
Hurst Walwyn was cherished as the gift of Sir Thomas himself.</p>

<p>Near her sat sister, Cecily St. John, a professed nun at Romsey
till her twenty-eight year, when, in the dispersion of convents,
her sister's home had received her.&nbsp; There had she continued,
never exposed to tests of opinion, but pursuing her quiet course
according to her Benedictine rule, faithfully keeping her vows, and
following the guidance of the chaplain, a college friend of Bishop
Ridley, and rejoicing in the use of the vernacular prayers and
Scriptures.&nbsp; When Queen Mary had sent for her to consider of
the revival of convents, her views had been found to have so far
diverged from those of the Queen that Lord Walwyn was thankful to
have her safe at home again; and yet she fancied herself firm to
old Romsey doctrine.&nbsp; She was not learned, like Lady Walwyn,
but her knowledge in all needlework and confectionery was
consummate, so that half the ladies in Dorset and Wilts longed to
send their daughters to be educated at Hurst Walwyn.&nbsp; Her
small figure and soft cheeks had the gentle contour of a dove's
form, nor had she lost the conventual serenity of expression;
indeed it was curious that, let Lady Walwyn array her as she would,
whatever she wore bore a nunlike air.&nbsp; Her silken farthingales
hung like serge robes, her ruffs looked like mufflers, her coifs
like hoods, even necklaces seemed rosaries, and her scrupulous
neatness enhanced the pure unearthly air of all belonging to
her.</p>

<p>Eager and lively, fair and handsome, sat the Baronne de
Ribaumont, or rather, since the higher title had been laid aside,
Dame Annora Thistlewood.&nbsp; The health of M. de Ribaumont had
been shattered at St. Quentin, and an inclement night of crossing
the Channel had brought on an attack on the lungs, from which he
only rallied enough to amaze his English friends at finding the gay
dissipated young Frenchman they remembered, infinitely more strict
and rigid than themselves.&nbsp; He was never able to leave the
house again after his first arrival at Hurst Walwyn, and sank under
the cold winds of the next spring, rejoicing to leave his wife and
son, not indeed among such strict Puritans as he preferred, but at
least where the pure faith could be openly avowed without
danger.</p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke Thistlewood, the husband to whom Annora Walwyn had
been destined before M. de Ribaumont had crossed her path, was
about the same time left a widower with one son and daughter, and
as soon as a suitable interval had passed, she became a far happier
wife than she had been in either the Baron's gay or grave
days.&nbsp; Her son had continued under the roof of his
grandfather, to whose charge his father had specially committed
him, and thus had been scarcely separated from his mother, since
Combe Manor was not above three miles across the downs from Hurst
Walwyn, and there was almost daily intercourse between the
families.&nbsp; Lucy Thistlewood had been brought to Hurst Walwyn
to be something between a maid of honour and a pupil to the ladies
there, and her brother Philip, so soon as he was old enough, daily
rode thither to share with Berenger the instructions of the
chaplain, Mr. Adderley, who on the present occasion formed one of
the conclave, sitting a little apart as not quite familiar, though
highly esteemed.</p>

<p>With an elbow on the table, and one hand toying with his long
riding-whip, sat, booted and spurred, the jovial figure of Sir
Marmaduke, who called out, in his hearty voice, 'A good riddance of
an outlandish Papist, say I!&nbsp; Read the letter, Berenger
lad.&nbsp; No, no, no!&nbsp; English it!&nbsp; I know nothing of
your mincing French!&nbsp; 'Tis the worst fault I know in you, boy,
to be half a Frenchman, and have a French name'--a fault that good
Sir Marmaduke did his best to remedy by always terming his step-son
Berenger or Berry Ribmount, and we will so far follow his example
as henceforth to give the youth the English form of his Christian
name.&nbsp; He was by this time a tall lad of eighteen, with
straight features, honest deep blue eyes, very fair hair cut short
and brushed up to a crest upon the middle of his head, a complexion
of red and white that all the air of the downs and the sea failed
to embrown, and that peculiar openness and candour of expression
which seems so much an English birthright, that the only trace of
his French origin was, that he betrayed no unbecoming awkwardness
in the somewhat embarrassing position in which he was placed,
literally standing, according to the respectful discipline of the
time, as the subject of discussion, before the circle of his
elders.&nbsp; His colour was indeed, deepened, but his attitude was
easy and graceful, and he used no stiff rigidity nor restless
movements to mask his anxiety.&nbsp; At Sir Marmaduke's desire, he
could not but redden a good deal more, but with a clear,
unhesitating voice, he translated, the letter that he had received
from the Chevalier de Ribaumont, who, by the Count's death, had
become Eustacie's guardian.&nbsp; It was a request in the name of
Eustacie and her deceased father, that Monsieur le Baron de
Ribaumont--who, it was understood, had embraced the English
heresy--would concur with his spouse in demanding from his Holiness
the Pope a decree annulling the childish marriage, which could
easily be declared void, both on account of the consanguinity of
the parties and the discrepancy of their faith; and which would
leave each of them free to marry again.</p>

<p>'Nothing can be better,' exclaimed his mother.&nbsp; 'How I have
longed to free him from that little shrew, whose tricks were the
plague of my life!&nbsp; Now there is nothing between him and a
worthy match!'</p>

<p>'We can make an Englishman of him now to the backbone,' added
Sir Marmaduke, 'and it is well that it should be the lady herself
who wants first to be off with it, so that none can say he has
played her a scurvy trick.'</p>

<p>'What say you, Berenger?'&nbsp; said Lord Walwyn.&nbsp; 'Listen
to me, fair nephew.&nbsp; You know that all my remnant of hope is
fixed upon you, and that I have looked to setting you in the room
of the son of my own; and I think that under our good Queen you
will find it easier to lead a quiet God-fearing life than in your
father's vexed country, where the Reformed religion lies under
persecution.&nbsp; Natheless, being a born liegeman of the King of
France, and heir to estates in his kingdom, meseemeth that before
you are come to years of discretion it were well that you should
visit them, and become better able to judge for yourself how to
deal in this matter when you shall have attained full age, and may
be able to dispose of them by sale, thus freeing yourself from
allegiance to a foreign prince.&nbsp; And at the same time you can
take measures, in concert with this young lady, for loosing the
wedlock so unhappily contracted.'</p>

<p>'O sir, sir!' cried Lady Thistlewood, 'send him not to France to
be burnt by the Papists!'</p>

<p>'Peace, daughter,' returned her mother.&nbsp; 'Know you not that
there is friendship between the court party and the Huguenots, and
that the peace is to be sealed by the marriage of the King's sister
with the King of Navarre?&nbsp; This is the most suitable time at
which he could go.'</p>

<p>'Then, madam,' proceeded the lady, 'he will be running about to
all the preachings on every bleak moor and wet morass he can find,
catching his death with rheums, like his poor father.'</p>

<p>There was a general smile, and Sir Marmaduke laughed
outright.</p>

<p>'Nay, dame,' he said, 'have you marked such a greed of sermons
in our Berry that you should fear his so untowardly running after
them?'</p>

<p>'Tilly-vally, Sir Duke,' quoth Dame Annora, with a flirt of her
fan, learnt at the French court.&nbsp; 'Men will run after a
preacher in a marshy bog out of pure forwardness, when they will
nod at a godly homily on a well-stuffed bench between four
walls.'</p>

<p>'I shall commit that matter to Mr. Adderley, who is good enough
to accompany him,' said Lord Walwyn, 'and by whose counsel I trust
that he will steer the middle course between the pope and
Calvin.'</p>

<p>Mr. Adderley bowed in answer, saying he hoped that he should be
enable to keep his pupil's mind clear between the allurements of
Popery and the errors of the Reformed; but meanwhile Lady
Thistlewood's mind had taken a leap, and she exclaimed,--</p>

<p>'And , son, whatever you do, bring home the chaplet of pearls! I
know they have set their minds upon it.&nbsp; They wanted me to
deck Eustacie with it on that unlucky bridal-day, but I would not
hear of trusting her with it, and now will it rarely become our
Lucy on your real wedding-day.'</p>

<p>'You travel swiftly, daughter,' said Lord Walwyn.&nbsp; 'Nor
have we yet heard the thoughts of one who ever thinks wisely.&nbsp;
Sister,' he added, turning to Cecily St. John, 'hold not you with
us in this matter?'</p>

<p>'I scarce comprehend it, my Lord,' was the gentle reply.&nbsp;
'I knew not that it was possible to dissolve the tie of
wedlock.'</p>

<p>'The Pope's decree will suffice,' said Lord Walwyn.</p>

<p>'Yet, sir,' still said the ex-nun, 'methought you had shown me
that the Holly Father exceeded his power in the annulling of
vows.'</p>

<p>'Using mine own lessons against me, sweet sister?' said Lord
Walwyn, smiling;&nbsp; 'yet, remember, the contract was rashly made
between two ignorant babes; and, bred up as they have severally
been, it were surely best for them to be set free from vows made
without their true will or knowledge.'</p>

<p>'And yet,' said Cecily, perplexed, 'when I saw my niece here
wedded to Sir Marmaduke, was it not with the words, "What God hath
joined let no man put asunder"?'</p>

<p>'Good lack! aunt,' cried Lady Thistlewood, 'you would not have
that poor lad wedded to a pert, saucy, ill-tempered little moppet,
bred up that den of iniquity, Queen Catherine's court, where my
poor Baron never trusted me after he fell in with the religion, and
had heard of King Antony's calling me the Swan of England.'</p>

<p>At that moment there was a loud shriek, half-laugh, half-fright,
coming through the window, and Lady Thistlewood, starting up,
exclaimed, 'The child will be drowned!&nbsp; Box their ears,
Berenger, and bring them in directly.'</p>

<p>Berenger, at her bidding, hurried out of the room into the hall,
and thence down a flight of steps leading into a square walled
garden, with a couple of stone male and female marine divinities
accommodating their fishy extremities as best they might on the
corners of the wall.&nbsp; The square contained a bowling-green of
exquisitely-kept turf, that looked as if cut out of green velvet,
and was edged on its four sides by a raised broad-paved walk, with
a trimming of flower-beds, where the earliest blossoms were showing
themselves.&nbsp; In the centre of each side another paved path
intersected the green lawn, and the meeting of these two diameters
was at a circular stone basin, presided over by another merman,
blowing a conch on the top of a pile of rocks.&nbsp; On the
gravelled margin stood two distressed little damsels of seven and
six years old, remonstrating with all their might against the
proceedings of a roguish-looking boy of fourteen of fifteen, who
had perched their junior--a fat, fair, kitten-like element of
mischief, aged about five--<i>en croupe</i> on the merman, and was
about, according to her delighted request, to make her a bower of
water, by extracting the plug and setting the fountain to play; but
as the fountain had been still all the winter, the plug was hard of
extraction, especially to a young gentleman who stood insecurely,
with his feet wide apart upon pointed and slippery point of
rock-work; and Berenger had time to hurry up, exclaiming, 'Giddy
pate! Dolly would Berenger drenched to the skin.'</p>

<p>'And she has on her best blue, made out of mother's French
farthingale,' cried the discreet Annora.</p>

<p>'Do you know, Dolly, I've orders to box your ears, and send you
in?' added Berenger, as he lifted his half-sister from her perilous
position, speaking, as he did so, without a shade of foreign
accent, though with much more rapid utterance than was usual in
England.&nbsp; She clung to him without much alarm, and retaliated
by an endeavour to box his ears, while Philip, slowly making his
way back to the mainland, exclaimed, 'Ah there's no chance
now!&nbsp; Here comes demure Mistress Lucy, and she is the worst
mar-sport of all.'</p>

<p>A gentle girl of seventeen was drawing near, her fair
delicately-tinted complexion suiting well with her pale golden
hair.&nbsp; It was a sweet face, and was well set off by the
sky-blue of the farthingale, which, with her white lace coif and
white ruff, gave her something the air of a speedwell flower, more
especially as her expression seemed to have caught much of Cecily's
air of self-restrained contentment.&nbsp; She held a basketful of
the orange pistils of crocuses, and at once seeing that some riot
had taken place, she said to the eldest little girl, 'Ah, Nan, you
had been safer gathering saffron with me.'</p>

<p>'Nay, brother Berry came and made all well,' said Annora; 'and
he had been shut up so long in the library that he must have been
very glad to get out.'</p>

<p>'And what came of it?' cried Philip.&nbsp; 'Are you to go and
get yourself unmarried?'</p>

<p>'Unmarried!' burst out the sisters Annora and Elizabeth.</p>

<p>'What, laughed Philip, 'you knew not that this is an ancient
husband, married years before your father and mother?'</p>

<p>'But, why?&nbsp; said Elizabeth, rather inclined to cry.&nbsp;
'What has poor Lucy done that you should get yourself unmarried
from her?'</p>

<p>There was a laugh from both brothers; but Berenger, seeing
Lucy's blushes, restrained himself, and said. 'Mine was not such
good luck, Bess, but they gave me a little French wife, younger
than Dolly, and saucier still; and as she seems to wish to be quit
of me, why, I shall be rid of her.'</p>

<p>'See there, Dolly,' said Philip, in a warning voice, 'that is
the way you'll be served if you do not mend your ways.'</p>

<p>'But I thought,' said Annora gravely, 'that people were married
once for all, and it could not be undone.'</p>

<p>'So said Aunt Cecily, but my Lord was proving to her out of all
law that a contract between such a couple of babes went for
nought,' said Berenger.</p>

<p>'And shall you, indeed, see Paris, and all the braveries there?'
asked Philip.&nbsp; 'I thought my Lord would never have trusted you
out of his sight.'</p>

<p>'And now it is to be only with Mr. Adderley,' said Berenger;
'but there will be rare doings to be seen at this royal wedding,
and maybe I shall break a lance there in your honour, Lucy.'</p>

<p>'And you'll bring me a French fan?' cried Bess.</p>

<p>'And me a pouncet-box?' added Annora.</p>

<p>'And me a French puppet dressed Paris fashion?' said Dolly.</p>

<p>'And what shall he bring Lucy?' added Bess.</p>

<p>'I know,' said Annora; 'the pearls that mother is always talking
about!&nbsp; I heard her say that Lucy should wear them on her
wedding-day.'</p>

<p>'Hush!' interposed Lucy, 'don't you see my father yonder on the
step, beckoning to you?'</p>

<p>The children flew towards Sir Marmaduke, leaving Berenger and
Lucy together.</p>

<p>'Not a word to wish me good speed, Lucy, now I have my wish?'
said Berenger.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said Lucy, 'I am glad you should see all those brave
French gentlemen of whom you used to tell me.'</p>

<p>'Yes, they will be all at court, and the good Admiral is said to
be in high favour.&nbsp; He will surely remember my father.'</p>

<p>'And shall you see the lady?' asked Lucy, under her breath.</p>

<p>'Eustacie?&nbsp; Probably; but that will make no change.&nbsp; I
have heard too much of <i>l'escadron de la Reine-mere</i> to endure
the thought of a wife from thence, were she the Queen of Beauty
herself.&nbsp; And my mother says that Eustacie would lose all her
beauty as she grew up--like black-eyed Sue on the down; nor did I
ever think her brown skin and fierce black eyes to compare with
you, Lucy.&nbsp; I could be well content never to see her more;
but,' and here he lowered his voice to a tone of confidence, 'my
father, when near his death, called me, and told me that he feared
my marriage would be a cause of trouble and temptation to me, and
that I must deal with it after my conscience when I was able to
judge in the matter.&nbsp; Something, too, he said of the treaty of
marriage being a burthen on his soul, but I know not what he
meant.&nbsp; If ever I saw Eustacie again, I was to give her his
own copy of Clement Marot's Psalter, and to tell her that he had
ever loved and prayed for her as a daughter; and moreover, my
father added,' said Berenger, much moved at the remembrance it
brought across him, 'that if this matter proved a burthen and
perplexity to me, I was to pardon him as one who repented of it as
a thing done ere he had learnt to weigh the whole world against a
soul.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you must see her,' said Lucy.</p>

<p>'Well, what more were you going to say, Lucy?'</p>

<p>'I was only thinking,' said Lucy, as she raised her eyes to him,
'how sorry she will be that she let them write that letter.'</p>

<p>Berenger laughed, pleased with the simplicity of Lucy's
admiration, but with modesty and common sense enough to answer, 'No
fear of that, Lucy, for an heiress, with all the court gallants of
France at her feet.'</p>

<p>'Ah, but you!'</p>

<p>'I am all very well here, when you have never seen anybody but
lubberly Dorset squires that never went to London, nor Oxford, nor
beyond their own furrows,' said Berenger; 'but depend upon it, she
has been bred up to care for all the airs and graces that are all
the fashion at Paris now, and will be as glad to be rid of an
honest man and a Protestant as I shall to be quit of a court puppet
and a Papist.&nbsp; Shall you have finished my point-cuffs next
week, Lucy?&nbsp; Depend upon it, no gentleman of them all will
wear such dainty lace of such a fancy as those will be.'</p>

<p>And Lucy smiled, well pleased.</p>

<p>Coming from the companionship of Eustacie to that of gentle Lucy
had been to Berenger a change from perpetual warfare to perfect
supremacy, and his preference to his little sister, as he had been
taught to call her from the first, had been loudly expressed.&nbsp;
Brother and sister they had ever since considered themselves, and
only within the last few months had possibilities been discussed
among the elders of the family, which oozing out in some mysterious
manner, had become felt rather than known among the young people,
yet without altering the habitual terms that existed between
them.&nbsp; Both were so young that love was the merest, vaguest
dream to them; and Lucy, in her quiet faith that Berenger was the
most beautiful, excellent, and accomplished cavalier the earth
could afford, was little troubled about her own future share in
him.&nbsp; She seemed to be promoted to belong to him just as she
had grown up to curl her hair and wear ruffs and
farthingales.&nbsp; And to Berenger Lucy was a very pleasant
feature in that English home, where he had been far happier than in
the uncertainties of Chateau Leurre, between his naughty
playfellow, his capricious mother, and morose father.&nbsp; If in
England his lot was to be cast, Lucy was acquiesced in willingly as
a portion of that lot.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; TITHONUS</h3>

<p>A youth came riding towards a palace gate,</p>

<p>And from the palace came a child of sin</p>

<p>And took him by the curls and led him in!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where sat a company with heated eyes.</p>

<p>Tennyson, A VISION OF SIN</p>

<p>It was in the month of June that Berenger de Ribaumont first
came in sight of Paris.&nbsp; His grandfather had himself begun by
taking him to London and presenting him to Queen Elizabeth, from
whom the lad's good mien procured him a most favourable
reception.&nbsp; She willingly promised that on which Lord Walwyn's
heart was set, namely, that his title and rank should be continued
to his grandson; and an ample store of letter of recommendation to
Sir Francis Walsingham, the Ambassador, and all others who could be
of service in the French court, were to do their utmost to provide
him with a favourable reception there.</p>

<p>Then, with Mr. Adderley and four or five servants, he had
crossed the Channel, and had gone first to Chateau Leurre, where he
was rapturously welcomed by the old steward Osbert.&nbsp; The old
man had trained up his son Landry, Berenger's foster-brother, to
become his valet, and had him taught all the arts of hair-dressing
and surgery that were part of the profession of a gentleman's
body-servant; and the youth, a smart, acuter young Norman, became a
valuable addition to the suite, the guidance of which, through a
foreign country, their young master did not find very easy.&nbsp;
Mr. Adderley thought he knew French very well, through books, but
the language he spoke was not available, and he soon fell into a
state of bewilderment rather hard on his pupil, who, though a very
good boy, and crammed very full of learning, was still nothing more
than a lad of eighteen in all matters of prudence and
discretion.</p>

<p>Lord Walwyn was, as we have seen, one of those whose Church
principles had altered very little and very gradually; and in the
utter diversity of practice that prevailed in the early years of
Queen Elizabeth, his chaplain as well as the rector of the parish
had altered no more than was absolutely enjoined of the old
ceremonial.&nbsp; If the poor Baron de Ribaumont had ever been well
enough to go to church on a Sunday, he would perhaps have thought
himself still in the realms of what he considered as darkness; but
as he had never openly broken with the Gallic Church, Berenger had
gone at once from mass at Leurre to the Combe Walwyn service.&nbsp;
Therefore when he spent a Sunday at Rouen, and attended a Calvinist
service in the building that the Huguenots were permitted outside
the town, he was much disappointed in it; he thought its very
fervour familiar and irreverent, and felt himself much more at home
in the cathedral into which he strayed in the afternoon.&nbsp; And,
on the Sunday he was at Leurre, he went, as a part of his old
home-habits, to mass at the old round-arched church, where he and
Eustacie had played each other so many teasing tricks at his
mother's feet, and had received so many admonitory nips and strokes
of her fan.&nbsp; All he saw there was not congenial to him, but he
liked it vastly better than the Huguenot meeting, and was not
prepared to understand or enter into Mr. Adderley's vexation, when
the tutor assured him that the reverent gestures that came
naturally to him were regarded by the Protestants as idolatry, and
that he would be viewed as a recreants from his faith. All
Mr.&nbsp; Adderley hoped was that no one would hear of it: and in
this he felt himself disappointed, when, in the midst of his
lecture, there walked into the room a little, withered, brown,
dark-eyed man, in a gorgeous dress of green and gold, who doffing a
hat with an umbrageous plume, precipitated himself, as far as he
could reach, towards Berenger's neck, calling him fair cousin and
dear baron.&nbsp; The lad stood taken by surprise for a moment,
thinking that Tithonus must have looked just like this, and skipped
like this, just as he became a grasshopper; then he recollected
that this must be the Chevalier de Ribaumont, and tried to make up
for his want of cordiality.&nbsp; The old man had, it appeared,
come out of Picardy, where he lived on <i>soupe maigre</i> in a
corner of the ancestral castle, while his son and daughter were at
court, the one in Monsieur's suite, the other in that of the
Queen-mother.&nbsp; He had come purely to meet his dear young
cousin, and render him all the assistance is his power, conduct him
to Paris, and give him introductions.</p>

<p>Berenger, who had begun to find six Englishmen a troublesome
charge in France, was rather relieved at not being the only French
scholar of the party, and the Chevalier also hinted to him that he
spoke with a dreadful Norman accent that would never be tolerated
at court, even if it were understood by the way.&nbsp; Moreover,
the Chevalier studied him all over, and talked of Paris tailors and
posture-masters, and, though the pink of politeness, made it
evident that there was immensely too much of him.&nbsp; 'It might
be the custom in England to be so tall; here no one was of anything
like such a height, but the Duke of Guise.&nbsp; He, in his
position, with his air, could carry it off, but we must adapt
ourselves as best we can.'</p>

<p>And his shrug and look of concern made Berenger for a moment
almost ashamed of that superfluous height of which they were all so
proud at home.&nbsp; Then he recollected himself, and asked, 'And
why should not I be tall as well as M. de Guise?'</p>

<p>'We shall see, fair cousin,' he answered, with an odd satirical
bow; 'we are as Heaven made us.&nbsp; All lies in the management
and if you had the advantages of training, PERHAPS you could even
turn your height into a grace.'</p>

<p>'Am I such a great lubber?' wondered Berenger; 'they did not
think so at home.&nbsp; No; nor did the Queen.&nbsp; She said I was
a proper stripling!&nbsp; Well, it matters the less, as I shall not
stay long to need their favour; and I'll show them there is some
use in my inches in the tilt-yard.&nbsp; But if they think me such
a lout, what would they say to honest Philip?'</p>

<p>The Chevalier seemed willing to take on him the whole management
of his 'fair cousin.'&nbsp; He inquired into the amount of the
rents and dues which old Osbert had collected and held ready to
meet the young Baron's exigencies; and which would, it seemed, be
all needed to make his dress any way presentable at court.&nbsp;
The pearls, too, were inquired for, and handed over by Osbert to
his young Lord's keeping, with the significant intimation that they
had been demanded when the young Madame la Baronne went to court;
but that he had buried them in the orchard, and made answer that
they were not in the chateau.&nbsp; The contract of marriage, which
Berenger could just remember signing, and seeing signed by his
father, the King, and the Count, was not forthcoming; and the
Chevalier explained that it was in the hands of a notary at
Paris.&nbsp; For this Berenger was not sorry.&nbsp; His grandfather
had desired him to master the contents, and he thought he had thus
escaped a very dry and useless study.</p>

<p>He did not exactly dislike the old Chevalier de Ribaumont.&nbsp;
The system on which he had been brought up had not been indulgent,
so that compliments and admiration were an agreeable surprise to
him; and rebuffs and rebukes from his elders had been so common,
that hints, in the delicate dressing of the old knight, came on him
almost like gracious civilities.&nbsp; There was no love lost
between the Chevalier and the chaplain, that was plain; but how
could there be between an ancient French courtier and a sober
English divine?&nbsp; However, to Mr. Adderley's great relief, no
attempts were made on Berenger's faith, his kinsman even was
disposed to promote his attendance at such Calvinist places of
worship as they passed on the road, and treated him in all things
as a mere guest, to be patronized indeed, but as much an alien as
if he had been born in England.&nbsp; And yet there was a certain
deference to him as head of the family, and a friendliness of
manner that made the boy feel him a real relation, and all through
the journey it came naturally that he should be the entire manager,
and Berenger the paymaster on a liberal scale.</p>

<p>Thus had the travellers reached the neighbourhood of Paris, when
a jingling of chains and a trampling of horses announced the
advance of riders, and several gentlemen with a troop of servants
came in sight.</p>

<p>All were gaily dressed, with feathered hats, and short Spanish
cloaks jauntily disposed over one shoulder; and their horses were
trapped with bright silvered ornaments.&nbsp; As they advanced, the
Chevalier exclaimed: 'Ah! It is my son!&nbsp; I knew he would come
to meet me.'&nbsp; And, simultaneously, father and son leapt from
their horses, and rushed into each other's arms.&nbsp; Berenger
felt it only courteous to dismount and exchange embraces with his
cousin, but with a certain sense of repulsion at the cloud of
perfume that seemed to surround the younger Chevalier de Ribaumont;
the ear-rings in his ears; the general air of delicate research
about his riding-dress, and the elaborate attention paid to a
small, dark, sallow face and figure, in which the only tolerable
feature was an intensely black and piercing pair of eyes.</p>

<p>'Cousin, I am enchanted to welcome you.'</p>

<p>'Cousin, I thank you.'</p>

<p>'Allow me to present you.'&nbsp; And Berenger bowed low in
succession several times in reply to salutations, as his cousin
Narcisse named M. d'O, M. de la Valette, M. de Pibrac, M. l'Abbe de
Mericour, who had done him the honour to accompany him in coming
out to meet his father and M. le Baron.&nbsp; Then the two cousins
remounted, something was said to the Chevalier of the devoirs of
the demoiselles, and they rode on together bandying news and
repartee so fast, that Berenger felt that his ears had become too
much accustomed to the more deliberate English speech to enter at
once into what caused so much excitement, gesture, and wit.&nbsp;
The royal marriage seemed doubtful--the Pope refused his sanction;
nay, but means would be found--the King would not be impeded by the
Pope; Spanish influence--nay, the King had thrown himself at the
head of the Reformed--he was bewitched with the grim old
Coligny--if order were not soon taken, the Louvre itself would
become a temple.</p>

<p>Then one of the party turned suddenly and said, 'But I forget,
Monsieur is a Huguenot?'</p>

<p>'I am a Protestant of the English Church,' said Berenger, rather
stiffly, in the formula of his day.</p>

<p>'Well, you have come at the right moment, 'Tis all for the
sermon now.&nbsp; If the little Abbe there wished to sail with a
fair wind, he should throw away his breviary and study his
Calvin.'</p>

<p>Berenger's attention was thus attracted to the Abbe de Mericour,
a young man of about twenty, whose dress was darker than that of
the rest, and his hat of a clerical cut, though in other respects
he was equipped with the same point-device elegance.</p>

<p>'Calvin would never give him the rich abbey of Selicy,' said
another; 'the breviary is the safer speculation.'</p>

<p>'Ah! M. de Ribaumont can tell you that abbeys are no such
securities in these days.&nbsp; Let yonder Admiral get the upper
hand, and we shall see Mericour, the happy cadet of eight brothers
and sisters, turned adrift from their convents.&nbsp; What a
fatherly spectacle M. le Marquis will present!'</p>

<p>Here the Chevalier beckoned to Berenger, who, riding forward,
learnt that Narcisse had engaged lodgings for him and his suite at
one of the great inns, and Berenger returned his thanks, and a
proposal to the Chevalier to become his guest.&nbsp; They were by
this time entering the city, where the extreme narrowness and dirt
of the streets contrasted with the grandeur of the palatial courts
that could be partly seen through their archways.&nbsp; At the
hostel they rode under such an arch, and found themselves in a
paved yard that would have been grand had it been clean.&nbsp;
Privacy had scarcely been invented, and the party were not at all
surprised to find that the apartment prepared for them was to serve
both day and night for Berenger, the Chevalier, and Mr. Adderley,
besides having a truckle-bed on the floor for Osbert.&nbsp; Meals
were taken in public, and it was now one o'clock--just dinner-time;
so after a hasty toilette the three gentlemen descended, the rest
of the party having ridden off to their quarters, either as
attendants of Monsieur or to their families.&nbsp; It was a
sumptuous meal, at which a great number of gentlemen were present,
coming in from rooms hired over shops, &amp;c--all, as it seemed,
assembled at Paris for the marriage festivities; but Berenger began
to gather that they were for the most part adherents of the Guise
party, and far from friendly to the Huguenot interest.&nbsp; Some
of them appeared hardly to tolerate Mr. Adderley's presence at the
table; and Berenger, though his kinsman's patronage secured civil
treatment, felt much out of his element, confused, unable to take
part in the conversation, and sure that he was where those at home
did not wish to see him.</p>

<p>No sooner was the dinner over than he rose and expressed his
intention of delivering his letters of introduction in person to
the English ambassador and to the Admiral de Coligny, whom, as his
father's old friend and the hero of his boyhood, he was most
anxious to see.&nbsp; The Chevalier demurred to this.&nbsp; Were it
not better to take measures at once for making himself presentable,
and Narcisse had already supplied him with directions to the
fashionable hair-cutter, &amp;c.&nbsp; It would be taken amiss if
he went to the Admiral before going to present himself to the
King.</p>

<p>'And I cannot see my cousins till I go to court?' asked
Berenger.</p>

<p>'Most emphatically No.&nbsp; Have I not told you that the one is
in the suite of the young Queen, the other in that of the
Queen-mother?&nbsp; I will myself present you, if only you will
give me the honour of your guidance.'</p>

<p>'With all thanks, Monsieur,' said Berenger; 'my grandfather's
desire was that I should lose no time in going to his friend Sir
Francis Walsingham, and I had best submit myself to his judgment as
to my appearance at court.'</p>

<p>On this point Berenger was resolute, though the Chevalier
recurred to the danger of any proceeding that might be unacceptable
at court.&nbsp; Berenger, harassed and impatient, repeated that he
did not care about the court, and wished merely to fulfil his
purpose and return, at which his kinsman shook his head and
shrugged his shoulders, and muttered to himself, 'Ah, what does he
know!&nbsp; He will regret it when too late; but I have done my
best.'</p>

<p>Berenger paid little attention to this, but calling Landry
Osbert, and a couple of his men, he bade them take their swords and
bucklers, and escort him in his walk through Paris.&nbsp; He set
off with a sense of escape, but before he had made many steps, he
was obliged to turn and warn Humfrey and Jack that they were not to
walk swaggering along the streets, with hand on sword, as if every
Frenchman they saw was the natural foe of their master.</p>

<p>Very tall were the houses, very close and extremely filthy the
streets, very miserable the beggars; and yet here and there was to
be seen the open front of a most brilliant shop, and the
thoroughfares were crowded with richly-dressed gallants.&nbsp; Even
the wider streets gave little space for the career of the gay
horsemen who rode along them, still less for the great, cumbrous,
though gaily-decked coaches, in which ladies appeared glittering
with jewels and fan in hand, with tiny white dogs on their
knees.</p>

<p>The persons of whom Berenger inquired the way all uncapped most
respectfully, and replied with much courtesy; but when the hotel of
the English ambassador had been pointed out to him, he hardly
believed it, so foul and squalid was the street, where a large
nail-studded door occupied a wide archway.&nbsp; Here was a heavy
iron knocker, to which Osbert applied himself.&nbsp; A little door
was at once opened by a large, powerful John Bull of a porter,
whose looks expanded into friendly welcome when he heard the
English tongue of the visitor.&nbsp; Inside, the scene was very
unlike that without.&nbsp; The hotel was built round a paved court,
adorned with statues and stone vases, with yews and cypresses in
them, and a grand flight of steps led up to the grand centre of the
house, around which were collected a number of attendants, wearing
the Walsingham colours.&nbsp; Among these Berenger left his two
Englishmen, well content to have fallen into an English
colony.&nbsp; Landry followed him to announce the visitor, Berenger
waiting to know whether the Ambassador would be at liberty to see
him.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the door was re-opened, and a keen-looking
gentleman, about six-and-thirty years of age, rather short in
stature, but nevertheless very dignified-looking, came forward with
out-stretched hands--'Greet you well, my Lord de Ribaumont.&nbsp;
We expected your coming.&nbsp; Welcome, mine honoured friend's
grandson.'</p>

<p>And as Berenger bent low in reverent greeting, Sir Francis took
his hand and kissed his brow, saying, 'Come in, my young friend; we
are but sitting over our wine and comfits after dinner.&nbsp; Have
you dined?'</p>

<p>Berenger explained that he had dined at the inn, where he had
taken lodgings.</p>

<p>'Nay, but that must not be.&nbsp; My Lord Walwyn's grandson
here, and not my guest!&nbsp; You do me wrong, sir, in not having
ridden hither at once.'</p>

<p>'Truly, my Lord, I ventured not.&nbsp; They sent me forth with
quite a company--my tutor and six grooms.'</p>

<p>'Our chaplain will gladly welcome his reverend brother,' said
Sir Francis; and as to the grooms, one of my fellows shall go and
bring them and their horses up.&nbsp; What!' rather gravely, as
Berenger still hesitated.&nbsp; 'I have letters for you here, which
methinks will make your grandfather's wish clear to you.'</p>

<p>Berenger saw the Ambassador was displeased with his reluctance,
and answered quickly, 'In sooth, my Lord, I would esteem myself
only too happy to be thus honoured, but in sooth----' he repeated
himself, and faltered.</p>

<p>'In sooth, you expected more freedom than in my grave house,'
said Walsingham, displeased.</p>

<p>'Not so, my Lord: it would be all that I could desire; but I
have done hastily.&nbsp; A kinsman of mine has come up to Paris
with me, and I have made him my guest.&nbsp; I know not how to
break with him--the Chevalier de Ribaumont.'</p>

<p>'What, the young ruffler in Monsieur's suite?'</p>

<p>'No, my Lord; his father.&nbsp; He comes on my business.&nbsp;
He is an old man, and can ill bear the cost, and I could scarce
throw him over.'</p>

<p>Berenger spoke with such earnest, bright, open simplicity, and
look so boyish and confiding, that Sir Francis's heart was won, and
he smiled as he said, 'Right, lad, you are a considerate
youth.&nbsp; It were not well to cast off your kinsman; but when
you have read your letters, you may well plead your grandfather's
desires, to say nothing of a hint from her Grace to have an eye to
you.&nbsp; And for the rest, you can acquit yourself gracefully to
the gentleman, by asking him to occupy the lodging that you had
taken.'</p>

<p>Berenger's face brightened up in a manner that spoke for his
sincerity; and Sir Francis added, 'And where be these
lodgings?'</p>

<p>'At the Croix de Lorraine.'</p>

<p>'Ha! Your kinsman has taken you into a nest of Guisards.&nbsp;
But come, let me present you to my wife and my other guests, then
will I give you your letters, and you shall return and make your
excuses to Monsieur le Chevalier.'</p>

<p>Berenger seemed to himself to be on familiar ground again as his
host thus assumed the direction of him and ushered him into a large
dining-hall, where the table had been forsaken in favour of a
lesser table placed in the ample window, round which sat assembled
some six or eight persons, with fruit, wine, and conserves before
them, a few little dogs at their feet or on their laps, and a lute
lying on the knee of one of the young gentlemen.&nbsp; Sir Francis
presented the young Lord de Ribaumont, their expected guest, to
Lady Walsingham, from whom he received a cordial welcome, and her
two little daughter, Frances and Elizabeth, and likewise to the
gentleman with the lute, a youth about a year older than Berenger,
and of very striking and prepossessing countenance, who was named
as Mr. Sidney, the son of the Lord Deputy of Ireland.&nbsp; A
couple of gentlemen who would in these times have been termed <i>
attaches</i>, a couple of lady attendants upon Lady Walsingham, and
the chaplain made up the party, which on this day chanced only to
include, besides the household, the young traveller, Sidney.&nbsp;
Berenger was at once seated, and accepted a welcoming-cup of wine
(i.e. a long slender glass with a beautifully twisted stem),
responded to friendly inquiries about his relatives at home, and
acknowledged the healths that were drunk in honour of their names;
after which Lady Walsingham begged that Mr. Sidney would sing the
madrigal he had before promised: afterwards a glee was sung by
Sidney, one of the gentlemen, and Lady Walsingham; and it was
discovered that Mr.&nbsp; de Ribaumont had a trained ear, and the
very voice that was wanting to the Italian song they were
practising.&nbsp; And so sped a happy hour, till a booted and
spurred messenger came in with letters for his Excellency, who
being thus roused from his dreamy enjoyment of the music, carried
young Ribaumont off with him to his cabinet, and there made over to
him a packet, with good news from home, and orders that made it
clear that he could do no other than accept the hospitality of the
Embassy.&nbsp; Thus armed with authority, he returned to the Croix
de Lorraine, where Mr. Adderley could not contain his joy at the
change to quarters not only so much more congenial, buts so much
safer; and the Chevalier, after some polite demur, consented to
remain in possession of the rooms, being in fact well satisfied
with the arrangement.</p>

<p>'Let him steep himself up to the lips among the English,' said
Tithonus to his son.&nbsp; 'Thus will he peaceably relinquish to
you all that should have been yours from the first, and at court
will only be looked on as an overgrown English page.'</p>

<p>The change to the Ambassador's made Berenger happy at
once.&nbsp; He was not French enough in breeding, or even
constitution, to feel the society of the Croix de Lorraine
congenial; and, kind as the Chevalier showed himself, it was with a
wonderful sense of relief that Berenger shook himself free from
both his fawning and his patronizing.&nbsp; There was a constant
sense of not understanding the old gentleman's aims, whereas in
Walsingham's house all was as clear, easy, and open as at home.</p>

<p>And though Berenger had been educated in the country, it had
been in the same tone as that of his new friends.&nbsp; He was
greatly approved by Sir Francis as a stripling of parts and
modesty.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Sidney made him a companion, and the young
matron, Lady Walsingham, treated him as neither lout nor
lubber.&nbsp; Yet he could not be at ease in his state between
curiosity and repulsion towards the wife who was to be discarded by
mutual consent.&nbsp; The sight of the scenes of his early
childhood had stirred up warmer recollections of the pretty little
playful torment, who through the vista of years assumed the air of
a tricksy elf rather than the little vixen he used to think
her.&nbsp; His curiosity had been further stimulated by the sight
of his rival, Narcisse, whose effeminate ornaments, small stature,
and seat on horseback filled Sir Marmaduke's pupil with inquisitive
disdain as to the woman who could prefer anything so unmanly.</p>

<p>Sidney was to be presented at the after-dinner reception at the
Louvre the next day, and Sir Francis proposed to take young
Ribaumont with him.&nbsp; Berenger coloured, and spoke of his
equipment, and Sidney good-naturedly offered to come and
inspect.&nbsp; That young gentleman was one of the daintiest in
apparel of his day; but he was amazed that the suit in which
Berenger had paid his devoir to Queen Elizabeth should have been
set aside--it was of pearl-grey velvet, slashed with rose-coloured
satin, and in shape and fashion point-device--unless, as the
Ambassador said good-humouredly, 'my young Lord Ribaumont wished to
be one of Monsieur's clique.'&nbsp; Thus arrayed, then, and with
the chaplet of pearls bound round the small cap, with a heron-plume
that sat jauntily on one side of his fair curled head, Berenger
took his seat beside the hazel-eyed, brown-haired Sidney, in his
white satin and crimson, and with the Ambassador and his attendants
were rolled off in the great state-coach drawn by eight horses,
which had no sinecure in dragging the ponderous machine through the
unsavoury <i>debris</i> of the streets.</p>

<p>Royalty fed in public.&nbsp; The sumptuous banqueting-room
contained a barrier, partitioning off a space where Charles IX. sat
alone at his table, as a State spectacle.&nbsp; He was a sallow,
unhealthy-looking youth, with large prominent dark eyes and a
melancholy dreaminess of expression, as if the whole ceremony, not
to say the world itself, were distasteful.&nbsp; Now and then, as
though endeavouring to cast off the mood, he would call to some
gentleman and exchange a rough jest, generally fortified with a
tremendous oath, that startled Berenger's innocent ears.&nbsp; He
scarcely tasted what was put on his plate, but drank largely of
sherbet, and seemed to be trying to linger through the space
allotted for the ceremony.</p>

<p>Silence was observed, but not so absolute that Walsingham could
not point out to his young companions the notabilities
present.&nbsp; The lofty figure of Henri, Duke of Guise, towered
high above all around him, and his grand features, proud lip, and
stern eye claimed such natural superiority that Berenger for a
moment felt a glow on his cheek as he remembered his challenge of
his right to rival that splendid stature.&nbsp; And yet Guise was
very little older than himself; but he walked, a prince of men,
among a crowd of gentlemen, attendants on him rather than on the
King.&nbsp; The elegant but indolent-looking Duke de Montmorency
had a much more attractive air, and seemed to hold a kind of
neutral ground between Guise on the one hand, and the Reformed, who
mustered at the other end of the apartment.&nbsp; Almost by
intuition, Berenger knew the fine calm features of the gray-haired
Admiral de Coligny before he heard him so addressed by the King's
loud, rough voice.&nbsp; When the King rose from table the
presentations took place, but as Charles heard the name of the
Baron de Ribaumont, he exclaimed, 'What, Monsieur, are you
presented here by our good sister's representative?'</p>

<p>Walsingham answered for him, alluding to the negotiations for
Queen Elizabeth's marriage with one of the French princes--'Sire,
in the present happy conjuncture, it needs not be a less loyal
Frenchman to have an inheritance in the lands of my royal
mistress.'</p>

<p>'What say you, Monsieur?' sharply demanded the King: 'are you
come here to renounce your country, religion--and love, as I have
been told?'</p>

<p>'I hope, Sire, never to be unfaithful where I owe faith,' said
Berenger, heated, startled, and driven to extremity.</p>

<p>'Not ill answered for the English giant,' said Charles aside to
an attendant: then turning eagerly to Sidney, whose transcendent
accomplishments had already become renowned, Charles welcomed him
to court, and began to discuss Ronsard's last sonnet, showing no
small taste and knowledge of poetry.&nbsp; Greatly attracted by
Sidney, the King detained the whole English party by an invitation
to Walsingham to hear music in the Queen-mother's apartments; and
Berenger, following in the wake of his friends, found himself in a
spacious hall, with a raised gallery at one end for the musicians,
the walls decorated with the glorious paintings collected by
Francois I., Greek and Roman statues clustered at the angles, and
cabinets with gems and antiques disposed at intervals.&nbsp; Not
that Berenger beheld much of this: he was absolutely dazzled with
the brilliant assembly into which he was admitted.&nbsp; There
moved the most beautiful women in France, in every lovely-coloured
tint that dress could assume: their bosoms, arms, and hair
sparkling with jewels; their gossamer ruffs surrounding their necks
like fairy wings; their light laugh mingling with the music, as
they sat, stood, or walked in graceful attitudes conversing with
one another or with the cavaliers, whose brilliant velvet and
jewels fifty mixed with their bright array.&nbsp; These were the
sirens he had heard of, the 'squadron of the Queen-mother,' the
dangerous beings against whom he was to steel himself.&nbsp; And
which of them was the child he had played with, to whom his vows
had been plighted?&nbsp; It was like some of the enchanting dreams
of romance merely to look at these fair creatures; and he stood as
if gazing into a magic-glass till Sir Francis Walsingham, looking
round for him, said, 'Come, then, my young friend, you must do your
devoirs to the Queens.&nbsp; Sidney, I see, is as usual in his
element; the King has seized upon him.'</p>

<p>Catherine de Medicis was seated on a large velvet chair,
conversing with the German ambassador.&nbsp; Never beautiful, she
appeared to more advantage in her mature years than in her
girlhood, and there was all the dignity of a lifetime of rule in
demeanour and gestures, the bearing of her head, and motion of her
exquisite hands.&nbsp; Her eyes were like her son's, prominent, and
gave the sense of seeing all round at once, and her smile was to
the highest degree engaging.&nbsp; She received the young Baron de
Ribaumont far more graciously than Charles has done, held out her
hand to be kissed, and observed 'that the young gentleman was like
Madame <i>sa mere</i> whom she well remembered as much
admired.&nbsp; Was it true that she was married in England?'</p>

<p>Berenger bowed assent.</p>

<p>'Ah! You English make good spouses,' she said, with a
smile.&nbsp; 'Ever satisfied with home!&nbsp; But, your
Excellency,' added she, turning to Walsingham, 'what stones would
best please my good sister for the setting of the jewel my son
would send her with his portrait?&nbsp; He is all for emeralds, for
the hue of hope; but I call it the colour of jealousy.'</p>

<p>Walsingham made a sign that Berenger had better retreat from
hearing the solemn coquetting carried on by the maiden Queen
through her gravest ambassadors.&nbsp; He fell back, and remained
watching the brilliant throng, trying in vain to discover the
bright merry eyes and velvet cheek he remembered of old.&nbsp;
Presently a kind salutation interrupted him, and a gentleman who
perceived him to be a stranger began to try to set him at ease,
pointed out to him the handsome, foppishly-dressed Duke of Anjou,
and his ugly, spiteful little brother of Alengon, then designated
as Queen Elizabeth's future husband, who was saying something to a
lady that made her colour and bite her lips.&nbsp; 'Is that the
younger Queen?' asked Berenger, as his eye fell on a sallow,
dark-complexioned, sad-looking little creature in deep mourning,
and with three or four such stately-looking, black-robed,
Spanish-looking duennas round her as to prove her to be a person of
high consequence.</p>

<p>'That?&nbsp; Oh no; that is Madame Catherine of Navarre, who has
resided here ever since her mother's death, awaiting her brother,
our royal bridegroom.&nbsp; See, here is the bride, Madame
Marguerite, conversing with M. de Guise.'</p>

<p>Berenger paid but little heed to Marguerite's showy but already
rather coarse beauty, and still asked where was the young Queen
Elizabeth of Austria.&nbsp; She was unwell, and not in
presence.&nbsp; 'Ah!&nbsp; then,' he said, 'her ladies will not be
here.'</p>

<p>'That is not certain.&nbsp; Are you wishing to see any one of
them?'</p>

<p>'I would like to see----' He could not help colouring till his
cheeks rivaled the colour of his sword-knot.&nbsp; 'I want just to
know if she is here.&nbsp; I know not if she be called Madame or
Mademoiselle de Ribaumont.'</p>

<p>'The fair Ribaumont!&nbsp; Assuredly; see, she is looking at
you.&nbsp; Shall I present you?'</p>

<p>A pair of exceedingly brilliant dark eyes were fixed on Berenger
with a sort of haughty curiosity and half-recognition.&nbsp; The
face was handsome and brilliant, but he felt indignant at not
perceiving a particle of a blush at encountering him, indeed rather
a look of amusement at the deep glow which his fair complexion
rendered so apparent.&nbsp; He would fain have escaped from so
public an interview, but her eye was upon him, and there was no
avoiding the meeting.&nbsp; As he moved nearer he saw what a
beautiful person she was, her rich primrose-coloured dress setting
off her brunette complexion and her stately presence.&nbsp; She
looked older than he had expected; but this was a hotbed where
every one grew up early, and the expression and manner made him
feel that an old intimacy was here renewed, and that they were no
strangers.</p>

<p>'We need no introduction, cousin,' she said, giving a hand to be
saluted.&nbsp; 'I knew you instantly.&nbsp; It is the old face of
Chateau Leurre, only gone up so high and become so handsome.'</p>

<p>'Cousins,' thought he.&nbsp; 'Well, it makes things easier! but
what audacity to be so much at her ease, when Lucy would have sunk
into the earth with shame.'&nbsp; His bow had saved him the
necessity of answering in words, and the lady continued:</p>

<p>'And Madame <i>votre mere</i>.&nbsp; Is she well?&nbsp; She was
very good to me.'</p>

<p>Berenger did not think that kindness to Eustacie had been her
chief perfection, but he answered that she was well and sent her
commendations, which the young lady acknowledged by a magnificent
curtsey.&nbsp; 'And as beautiful as ever?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Quite as beautiful,' he said, 'only somewhat more <i>
embonpoint</i>.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' she said, smiling graciously, and raising her splendid
eyes to his face, 'I understand better what that famous beauty was
now, and the fairness that caused her to be called the Swan.'</p>

<p>It was so personal that the colour rushed again into his
cheek.&nbsp; No one had ever so presumed to admire him; and with a
degree gratified and surprised, and sensible more and more of the
extreme beauty of the lady, there was a sort of alarm about him as
if this were the very fascination he had been warned against, and
as if she were casting a net about him, which, wife as she was, it
would be impossible to him to break.</p>

<p>'Nay, Monsieur,' she laughed, 'is a word from one so near too
much for your modesty?&nbsp; Is it possible that no one has yet
told you of your good mien?&nbsp; Or do they not appreciate Greek
noses and blue eyes in the land of fat Englishmen?&nbsp; How have
you ever lived <i>en province?</i>&nbsp; Our&nbsp; princes are
ready to hang themselves at the thought of being in such
banishment, even at court--indeed, Monsieur has contrived to
transfer the noose to M. d'Alengon.&nbsp; Have you been at court,
cousin?'</p>

<p>'I have been presented to the Queen.'</p>

<p>She then proceeded to ask questions about the chief personages
with a rapid intelligence that surprised him as well as alarmed
him, for he felt more and more in the power of a very clever as
well as beautiful woman, and the attraction she exercised made him
long the more to escape; but she smiled and signed away several
cavaliers who would have gained her attention.&nbsp; She spoke of
Queen Mary of Scotland, then in the fifth years of her captivity,
and asked if he did not feel bound to her service by having been
once her partner.&nbsp; Did not he remember that dance?</p>

<p>'I have heard my mother speak of it far too often to forget it,'
said Berenger, glowing again for her who could speak of that
occasion without a blush.</p>

<p>'You wish to gloss over your first inconstancy, sir,' she said,
archly; but he was spared from further reply by Philip Sidney's
coming to tell him that the Ambassador was ready to return
home.&nbsp; He took leave with an alacrity that redoubled his
courtesy so much that he desired to be commended to his cousin
Diane, whom he had not seen.</p>

<p>'To Diane?' said the lady, inquiringly.</p>

<p>'To Mademoiselle Diane de Ribaumont,' he corrected himself,
ashamed of his English rusticity.&nbsp; 'I beg pardon if I spoke
too familiarly of her.'</p>

<p>'She should be flattered by M. le Baron's slightest
recollection,' said the lady, with an ironical tone that there was
no time to analyze, and with a mutual gesture of courtesy he
followed Sidney to where Sir Francis awaited them.</p>

<p>'Well, what think you of the French court?' asked Sidney, so
soon as the young men were in private.</p>

<p>'I only know that you may bless your good fortune that you stand
in no danger from a wife from thence.'</p>

<p>'Ha!' cried Sidney, laughing, 'you found your lawful
owner.&nbsp; Why did you not present me?'</p>

<p>'I was ashamed of her bold visage.'</p>

<p>'What!--was she the beauteous demoiselle I found you
gallanting,' said Philip Sidney, a good deal entertained, 'who was
gazing at you with such visible admiration in her languishing black
eyes?'</p>

<p>'The foul fiend seize their impudence!'</p>

<p>'Fie! for shame! thus to speak of your own wife,' said the
mischievous Sidney, 'and the fairest----'</p>

<p>'Go to, Sidney.&nbsp; Were she fairer than Venus, with a kingdom
to her dower, I would none of a woman without a blush.'</p>

<p>'What, in converse with her wedded husband,' said Sidney.&nbsp;
'Were not that over-shamefastness?'</p>

<p>'Nay, now, Sidney, in good sooth give me your opinion.&nbsp;
Should she set her fancy on me, even in this hour, am I bound in
honour to hold by this accursed wedlock--lock, as it may well be
called?'</p>

<p>'I know no remedy,' said Sidney, gravely, 'save the two
enchanted founts of love and hate.&nbsp; They cannot be far away,
since it was at the siege of Paris that Rinaldo and Orlando drank
thereof.'</p>

<p>Another question that Berenger would fain have asked Sidney, but
could not for very shame and dread of mockery, was, whether he
himself were so dangerously handsome as the lady had given him to
understand.&nbsp; With a sense of shame, he caught up the little
mirror in his casket, and could not but allow to himself that the
features he there saw were symmetrical--the eyes azure, the
complexion of a delicate fairness, such as he had not seen
equalled, except in those splendid Lorraine princes; nor could he
judge of the further effect of his open-faced frank simplicity and
sweetness of expression-- contemptible, perhaps, to the astute, but
most winning to the world-weary.&nbsp; He shook his head at the
fair reflection, smiled as he saw the colour rising at his own
sensation of being a fool, and then threw it aside, vexed with
himself for being unable not to feel attracted by the first woman
who had shown herself struck by his personal graces, and yet aware
that this was the very thing he had been warned against, and
determined to make all the resistance in his power to a creature
whose very beauty and enchantment gave him a sense of
discomfort.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; THE CONVENT BIRD</h3>

<p>Young knight, whatever that dost armes professe,</p>

<p>And through long labours huntest after fame,</p>

<p>Beware of fraud, beware of ficklenesse,</p>

<p>In choice and change of thy beloved dame.</p>

<p>Spenser, FAERY QUEENE</p>

<p>Berenger's mind was relieved, even while his vanity was
mortified, when the Chevalier and his son came the next day to
bring him the formal letter requesting the Pope's annulment of his
marriage.&nbsp; After he had signed it, it was to be taken to
Eustacie, and so soon as he should attain his twenty-first year he
was to dispose of Chateau Leurre, as well as of his claim to the
ancestral castle in Picardy, to his cousin Narcisse, and thus
become entirely free to transfer his allegiance to the Queen of
England.</p>

<p>It was a very good thing--that he well knew; and he had a strong
sense of virtue and obedience, as he formed with his pen the words
in all their fullness, Henri Beranger Eustache, Baron de Ribaumont
et Seigneur de Leurre.&nbsp; He could not help wondering whether
the lady who looked at him so admiringly really preferred such a
mean-looking little fop as Narcisse, whether she were afraid of his
English home and breeding, or whether all this open coquetry were
really the court manners of ladies towards gentlemen, and he had
been an absolute simpleton to be flattered.&nbsp; Any way, she
would have been a most undesirable wife, and he was well quit of
her; but he did feel a certain lurking desire that, since the bonds
were cut and he was no longer in danger from her, he might see her
again, carry home a mental inventory of the splendid beauties he
had renounced, and decide what was the motive that actuated her in
rejecting his own handsome self.&nbsp; Meantime, he proceeded to
enjoy the amusements and advantage of his sojourn at Paris, of
which by no means the least was the society of Philip Sidney, and
the charm his brilliant genius imparted to every pursuit they
shared.&nbsp; Books at the University, fencing and dancing from the
best professors, Italian poetry, French sonnets, Latin epigrams;
nothing came amiss to Sidney, the flower of English youth: and
Berenger had taste, intelligence, and cultivation enough to enter
into all in which Sidney led the way.&nbsp; The good tutor, after
all his miseries on the journey, was delighted to write to Lord
Walwyn, that, far from being a risk and temptation, this visit was
a school in all that was virtuous and comely.</p>

<p>If the good man had any cause of dissatisfaction, it was with
the Calvinistic tendencies of the Ambassador's household.&nbsp;
Walsingham was always on the Puritanical side of Elizabeth's court,
and such an atmosphere as that of Paris, where the Roman Catholic
system was at that time showing more corruption than it has ever
done before or since in any other place, naturally threw him into
sympathy with the Reformed.&nbsp; The reaction that half a century
later filled the Gallican Church with saintliness had not set in;
her ecclesiastics were the tools of a wicked and bloodthirsty
court, who hated virtue as much as schism in the men whom they
persecuted.&nbsp; The Huguenots were for the most part men whose
instincts for truth and virtue had recoiled from the popular
system, and thus it was indeed as if piety and morality were
arrayed on one side, and superstition and debauchery on the
other.&nbsp; Mr. Adderley thus found the tone of the Ambassador's
chaplain that of far more complete fellowship with the Reformed
pastors than he himself was disposed to admit.&nbsp; There were a
large number of these gathered at Paris ; for the lull in
persecution that had followed the battle of Moncontour had given
hopes of a final accommodation between the two parties, and many
had come up to consult with the numerous lay nobility who had
congregated to witness the King of Navarre's wedding.&nbsp; Among
them, Berenger met his father's old friend Isaac Gardon, who had
come to Paris for the purpose of giving his only surviving son in
marriage to the daughter of a watchmaker to whom he had for many
years been betrothed.&nbsp; By him the youth, with his innocent
face and gracious respectful manners, was watched with delight, as
fulfilling the fairest hopes of the poor Baron, but the old
minister would have been sorely disappointed had he known how
little Berenger felt inclined towards his party.</p>

<p>The royal one of course Berenger could not love, but the rigid
bareness, and, as he thought, irreverence of the Calvinist, and the
want of all forms, jarred upon one used to a ritual which retained
much of the ancient form.&nbsp; In the early years of Elizabeth,
every possible diversity prevailed in parish churches, according to
the predilections of rector and squire; from forms scarcely altered
from those of old times, down to the baldest, rudest neglect of all
rites ; and Berenger, in his country home, had been used to the
first extreme.&nbsp; He could not believe that what he heard and
saw among the <i>Sacrementaires</i>, as they were called, was what
his father had prized; and he greatly scandalized Sidney, the pupil
of Hubert Languet, by openly expressing his distaste and dismay
when he found their worship viewed by both Walsingham and Sidney as
a model to which the English Protestants ought to be brought.</p>

<p>However, Sidney excused all this as more boyish distaste to
sermons and love of externals, and Berenger himself reflected
little on the subject.&nbsp; The aspect of the venerable Coligny,
his father's friend, did far more towards making him a Huguenot
than any discussion of doctrine.&nbsp; The good old Admiral
received him affectionately, and talked to him warmly of his
father, and the grave, noble countenance and kind manner won his
heart.&nbsp; Great projects were on foot, and were much relished by
the young King, for raising an army and striking a blow at Spain by
aiding the Reformed in the Netherlands; and Coligny was as ardent
as a youth in the cause, hoping at once to aid his brethren, to
free the young King from evil influences, and to strike one good
stroke against the old national enemy.&nbsp; He talked eagerly to
Sidney of alliances with England, and then lamented over the loss
of so promising a youth as young Ribaumont to the Reformed cause in
France. If the marriage with the heiress could have taken effect,
he would have obtained estates near enough to some of the main
Huguenot strongholds to be very important, and these would now
remain under the power of Narcisse de Ribaumont, a determined ally
of the Guise faction.&nbsp; It was a pity, but the Admiral could
not blame the youth for obeying the wish of his guardian
grandfather; and he owned, with a sigh, that England was a more
peaceful land than his own beloved country.&nbsp; Berenger was a
little nettled at this implication, and began to talk of joining
the French standard in a campaign in their present home and
described the conversation, Walsingham said, --</p>

<p>'The Admiral's favourite project!&nbsp; He would do wisely not
to brag of it so openly.&nbsp; The King of Spain has too many in
his interest in this place not to be warned, and to be thus further
egged on to compass the ruin of Coligny.'</p>

<p>'I should have thought.' Said Sidney. 'that nothing could add to
his hatred of the Reformed.'</p>

<p>'Scarcely,' said Walsingham; 'save that it is they who hinder
the Duke of Guise from being a good Frenchman, and a foe to
Spain.'</p>

<p>Politics had not developed themselves in Berenger's mind, and he
listened inattentively while Walsingham talked over with Sidney the
state of parties in France, where natural national enmity to Spain
was balanced by the need felt by the Queen-mother of the support of
that great Roman Catholic power against the Huguenots; whom
Walsingham believed her to dread and hate less for their own sake
than from the fear of loss of influence over her son.&nbsp; He
believed Charles IX. himself to have much leaning towards the
Reformed, but the late victories has thrown the whole court
entirely into the power of the Guises, the truly unscrupulous
partisans of Rome.&nbsp; They were further inflamed against the
Huguenots by the assassination of the last Duke of Guise, and by
the violences that had been committed by some of the Reformed
party, in especial a massacre of prisoners at <i>Nerac</i>.</p>

<p>Sidney exclaimed that the Huguenots had suffered far worse
cruelties.</p>

<p>'That is true,' replied Sir Francis, 'but, my young friend, you
will find, in all matters of reprisals, that a party has no memory
for what it may commit, only for what it may receive.'</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by an invitation to the
Ambassador's family and guests to a tilting-match and subsequent
ball at the Louvre.&nbsp; In the first Berenger did his part with
credit; to the second he went feeling full of that strange
attraction of repulsion.&nbsp; He knew gentlemen enough in
Coligny's suite for it to be likely that he might remain
unperceived among them, and he knew this would be prudent, but he
found himself unexpectedly near the ranks of ladies, and smile and
gesture absolutely drew him towards his semi-spouse, so that he had
no alternative but to lead her out to dance.</p>

<p>The stately measure was trod in silence as usual, but he felt
the dark eyes studying him all the time.&nbsp; However, he could
bear it better now that the deed was done, and she had voluntarily
made him less to her than any gallant parading or mincing about the
room.</p>

<p>'So you bear the pearls, sir?' she said, as the dance
finished.</p>

<p>'The only heirloom I shall take with me,' he said.</p>

<p>'Is a look at them too great a favour to ask from their jealous
guardian?' she asked.</p>

<p>He smiled, half ashamed of his own annoyance at being obliged to
place them in her hands.&nbsp; He was sure she would try to cajole
him out of them, and by way of asserting his property in them he
did not detach them from the band of his black velvet cap, but gave
it with them into her hand.&nbsp; She looked at each one, and
counted them wistfully.</p>

<p>'Seventeen!' she said;' and how beautiful!&nbsp; I never saw
them so near before.&nbsp; They are so becoming to that fair cheek
that I suppose no offer from my--my uncle, on our behalf, would
induce you to part with them?'</p>

<p>An impulse of open-handed gallantry would have made him answer,
'No offer from your uncle, but a simple request from you;' but he
thought in time of the absurdity of returning without them, and
merely answered, 'I have no right to yield them, fair lady.&nbsp;
They are the witness to my forefather's fame and prowess.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, and to those of mine also,' she replied. 'And you
would take them over to the enemy from whom that prowess extorted
them?'</p>

<p>'The country which honoured and rewarded that prowess!' replied
Berenger.</p>

<p>She looked at him with an interrogative glance of surprise at
the readiness of his answer; then, with half a sigh, said, 'There
are your pearls, sir; I cannot establish our right, though I verily
believe it was the cause of our last quarrel;' and she smiled
archly.</p>

<p>'I believe it was,' he said, gravely; but added, in the moment
of relief at recovering the precious heirloom, 'though it was Diane
who inspired you to seize upon them.'</p>

<p>'Ah! poor Diane! you sometimes recollect her then?&nbsp; If I
remember right, you used to agree with her better than with your
little spouse, cousin!'</p>

<p>'If I quarrelled with her less, I liked her less,' answered
Berenger--who, since the act of separation, had not been so guarded
in his demeanour, and began to give way to his natural
frankness.</p>

<p>'Indeed!&nbsp; Diane would be less gratified than I ought to
be.&nbsp; And why, may I ask?'</p>

<p>'Diane was more caressing, but she had no truth.'</p>

<p>'Truth! that was what <i>feu</i> M. le Baron ever talked of;
what Huguenots weary one with.'</p>

<p>'And the only thing worth seeking, the real pearl,' said
Berenger, 'without which all else is worthless.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' she said, 'who would have thought that soft, youthful face
could be so severe!&nbsp; You would never forgive a deceit?'</p>

<p>'Never,' he said, with the crystal hardness of youth; 'or rather
I might forgive; I could never esteem.'</p>

<p>'What a bare, rude world yours must be,' she said, shivering.
'And no weak ones in it!&nbsp; Only the strong can dare to be
true.'</p>

<p>'Truth is strength!' said Berenger. 'For example: I see yonder a
face without bodily strength, perhaps, but with perfect
candour.'</p>

<p>'Ah! some Huguenot girl of Madame Catherine's, no doubt--from
the depths of Languedoc, and dressed like a fright.'</p>

<p>'No, no; the young girl behind the pale, yellow-haired
lady.'</p>

<p>'<i>Comment</i>, Monsieur.&nbsp; Do you not yet know the young
Queen?'</p>

<p>'But who is the young demoiselle!--she with the superb black
eyes, and the ruby rose in her black hair?'</p>

<p>'Take care, sir, do you not know I have still a right to be
jealous?' she said, blushing, bridling, and laughing.</p>

<p>But this pull on the cords made him the more resolved; he would
not be turned from his purpose. 'Who is she?' he repeated; 'have I
ever seen her before? I am sure I remember that innocent look of
<i>espieglerie</i>.'</p>

<p>'You may see it on any child's face fresh out of the convent; it
does not last a month!' was the still displeased, rather jealous
answer.&nbsp; 'That little thing--I believe they call her
Nid-de-Merle-- she has only just been brought from her nunnery to
wait on the young Queen.&nbsp; Ah! your gaze was perilous, it is
bringing on you one of the jests of Madame Marguerite.'</p>

<p>With laughter and gaiety, a troop of gentlemen descended on M.
de Ribaumont, and told him that Madame Marguerite desired that he
should be presented to her.&nbsp; The princess was standing by her
pale sister-in-law, Elizabeth of Austria, who looked grave and
annoyed at the mischievous mirth flashing in Marguerite's dark
eyes.</p>

<p>'M. de Ribaumont,' said the latter, her very neck heaving with
suppressed fun, 'I see I cannot do you a greater favour than by
giving you Mademoiselle de Nid-de-Merle for your partner.'</p>

<p>Berenger was covered with confusion to find that he had been
guilty of such a fixed stare as to bring all this upon the poor
girl. He feared that his vague sense of recognition had made his
gaze more open than he knew, and he was really and deeply ashamed
of this as his worst act of provincial ill-breeding.</p>

<p>Poor little convent maid, with crimson cheeks, flashing eyes,
panting bosom, and a neck evidently aching with proud dignity and
passion, she received his low bow with a sweeping curtsey, as lofty
as her little person would permit.</p>

<p>His cheeks burnt like fire, and he would have found words to
apologize, but she cut him short by saying, hastily and low, 'Not a
word, Monsieur!&nbsp; Let us go through it at once.&nbsp; No one
shall make game of us.'</p>

<p>He hardly durst look at her again; but as he went through his
own elaborate paces he knew that the little creature opposite was
swimming, bending, turning, bounding with the fluttering fierceness
of an angry little bird, and that the superb eyes were casting
flashes on him that seemed to carry him back to days of early
boyhood.</p>

<p>Once he caught a mortified, pleading, wistful glance that made
him feel as if he had inflicted a cruel injury by his thoughtless
gaze, and he resolved to plead the sense of recognition in excuse;
but no sooner was the performance over than she prevented all
conversation by saying, 'Lead me back at once to the Queen, sir;
she is about to retire.'&nbsp; They were already so near that there
was no time to say anything; he could only hold as lightly as
possible the tiny fingers that he felt burning and quivering in his
hand, and then, after bringing her to the side of the chair of
state, he was forced to release her with the mere whisper of
'Pardon, Mademoiselle;' and the request was not replied to, save by
the additional stateliness of her curtsey.</p>

<p>It was already late, and the party was breaking up; but his head
and heart were still in a whirl when he found himself seated in the
ambassadorial coach, hearing Lady Walsingham's well-pleased
rehearsal of all the compliments she had received on the
distinguished appearance of both her young guests. Sidney, as the
betrothed of her daughter, was property of her own; but she also
exulted in the praises of the young Lord de Ribaumont, as proving
the excellence of the masters whom she had recommended to remove
the rustic clownishness of which he had been accused.</p>

<p>'Nay,' said Sir Francis; 'whoever called him too clownish for
court spake with design.'</p>

<p>The brief sentence added to Berenger's confused sense of being
in a mist of false play.&nbsp; Could his kinsman be bent on keeping
him from court?&nbsp; Could Narcisse be jealous of him?&nbsp;
Mademoiselle de Ribaumont was evidently inclined to seek him, and
her cousin might easily think her lands safer in his absence. He
would have been willing to hold aloof as much as his uncle and
cousin could wish, save for an angry dislike to being duped and
cajoled; and, moreover, a strong curiosity to hear and see more of
that little passionate bird, fresh from the convent cage.&nbsp; Her
gesture and her eyes irresistibly carried him back to old times,
though whether to an angry blackbird in the yew-tree alleys at
Leurre, or to the eager face that had warned him to save his
father, he could not remember with any distinctness. At any rate,
he was surprised to find himself thinking so little in comparison
about the splendid beauty and winning manners of his discarded
spouse, though he quite believed that, now her captive was beyond
her grasp, she was disposed to catch at him again, and try to
retain him, or, as his titillated vanity might whisper, his
personal graces might make her regret the family resolution which
she had obeyed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; FOULLY COZENED</h3>

<p>I was the more deceived.--HAMLET</p>

<p>The unhappy Charles IX. had a disposition that in good hands
might have achieved great nobleness; and though cruelly bound and
trained to evil, was no sooner allowed to follow its natural bent
than it reached out eagerly towards excellence.&nbsp; At this
moment, it was his mother's policy to appear to leave the
ascendancy to the Huguenot party, and he was therefore allowed to
contract friendships which deceived the intended victims the more
completely, because his admiration and attachment were spontaneous
and sincere.&nbsp; Philip Sidney's varied accomplishment and pure
lofty character greatly attracted the young King, who had leant on
his arm conversing during great part of the ball, and the next
morning sent a royal messenger to invite the two young gentlemen to
a part at pall-mall in the Tuilleries gardens.</p>

<p>Pall-mall was either croquet or its nearest relative, and was so
much the fashion that games were given in order to keep up
political influence, perhaps, because the freedom of a garden
pastime among groves and bowers afforded opportunities for those
seductive arts on which Queen Catherine placed so much
dependence.&nbsp; The formal gardens, with their squares of level
turf and clipped alleys, afforded excellent scope both for players
and spectators, and numerous games had been set on foot, from all
of which, however, Berenger contrived to exclude himself, in his
restless determination to find out the little Demoiselle de
Nid-de-Merle, or, at least, to discover whether any intercourse in
early youth accounted for his undefined sense of remembrance.</p>

<p>He interrogated the first disengaged person he could find, but
it was only the young Abbe de Mericour, who had been newly brought
up from Dauphine by his elder brother to solicit a benefice, and
who knew nobody.&nbsp; To him ladies were only bright phantoms such
as his books had taught him to regard like the temptations of St.
Anthony, but whom he actually saw treated with as free admiration
by the ecclesiastic as by the layman.</p>

<p>Suddenly a clamour of voices arose on the other side of the
closely-clipped wall of limes by which the two youths were
walking.&nbsp; There were the clear tones of a young maiden
expostulating in indignant distress, and the bantering, indolent
determination of a male annoyer.</p>

<p>'Hark!' exclaimed Berenger; 'this must be seen to.'</p>

<p>'Have a care,' returned Mericour; 'I have heard that a man needs
look twice are meddling.'</p>

<p>Scarcely hearing, Berenger strode on as he had done at the last
village wake, when he had rescued Cis of the Down from the
impertinence of a Dorchester scrivener.&nbsp; It was a like case,
he saw, when breaking through the arch of clipped limed he beheld
the little Demoiselle de Nid-de-Merle, driven into a corner and
standing at bay, with glowing cheeks, flashing eyes, and hands
clasped over her breast, while a young man, dressed in the extreme
of foppery, was assuring her that she was the only lady who had not
granted him a token--that he could not allow such <i>
pensionnaire</i> airs, and that now he had caught her he would have
his revenge, and win her rose-coloured break-knot.&nbsp; Another
gentleman stood by, laughing, and keeping guard in the walk that
led to the more frequented part of the gardens.</p>

<p>'Hold!' thundered Berenger.</p>

<p>The assailant had just mastered the poor girl's hand, but she
took advantage of his surprise to wrench it away and gather herself
up as for a spring, but the Abbe in dismay, the attendant in anger,
cried out, 'Stay--it is Monsieur.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur; be he who he may,' exclaimed Berenger, 'no honest man
can see a lady insulted.'</p>

<p>'Are you mad?&nbsp; It is Monsieur the Duke of Anjou,' said
Mericour, pouncing on his arm.</p>

<p>'Shall we have him to the guardhouse?' added the attendant,
coming up on the other side; but Henri de Valois waved them both
back, and burst into a derisive laugh.&nbsp; 'No, no; do you not
see who it is?&nbsp; Monsieur the English Baron still holds the end
of the halter.&nbsp; His sale is not yet made.&nbsp; Come away,
D'O, he will soon have enough on his hands without us.&nbsp;
Farewell, fair lady, another time you will be free of your jealous
giant.'</p>

<p>So saying, the Duke of Anjou strolled off, feigning indifference
and contempt, and scarcely heeding that he had been traversed in
one of the malicious adventures which he delighted to recount in
public before the discomfited victim herself, often with shameful
exaggeration.</p>

<p>The girl clasped her hands over her brow with a gesture of
dismay, and cried, 'Oh! if you have only not touched your
sword.'</p>

<p>'Let me have the honour of reconducting you, Mademoiselle,' said
Berenger, offering his hand; but after the first sigh of relief, a
tempestuous access seized her.&nbsp; She seemed about to dash away
his hand, her bosom swelled with resentment, and with a voice
striving for dignity, though choked with strangled tears, she
exclaimed, 'No, indeed!&nbsp; Had not M. le Baron forsaken me, I
had never been thus treated!' and her eyes flashed through their
moisture.</p>

<p>'Eustacie!&nbsp; You are Eustacie!'</p>

<p>'Whom would you have me to be otherwise?&nbsp; I have the honour
to wish M. le Baron a good morning.'</p>

<p>'Eustacie!&nbsp; Stay!&nbsp; Hear me!&nbsp; It concerns my
honour.&nbsp; I see it is you--but whom have I seen?&nbsp; Who was
she?' he cried, half wild with dismay and confusion.&nbsp; 'Was it
Diane?'</p>

<p>'You have seen and danced with Diane de Ribaumont,' answered
Eustacie, still coldly; 'but what of that?&nbsp; Let me go,
Monsieur; you have cast me off already.'</p>

<p>'I! when all this has been of your own seeking?'</p>

<p>'Mine?' cried Eustacie, panting with the struggle between her
dignity and her passionate tears.&nbsp; 'I meddled not.&nbsp; I
heard that M.&nbsp; le Baron was gone to a strange land, and had
written to break off old ties.'&nbsp; Her face was in a flame, and
her efforts for composure absolute pain.</p>

<p>'I!' again exclaimed Berenger.&nbsp; 'The first letter came from
your uncle, declaring that it was your wish!'&nbsp; And as her face
changed rapidly, 'Then it was not true!&nbsp; He has not had your
consent?'</p>

<p>'What! would I hold to one who despised me--who came here and
never even asked to see this hated spouse!'</p>

<p>I did!&nbsp; I entreated to see you.&nbsp; I would not sign the
application till--Oh, there has been treachery!&nbsp; And have they
made you too sign it!'</p>

<p>When they showed me your name they were welcome to mine.'</p>

<p>Berenger struck his forehead with wrath and perplexity, then
cried, joyfully, 'It will not stand for moment.&nbsp; So foul a
cheat can be at once exposed. Eustacie, you know--you understand,
that it was not you but Diane whom I saw and detested; and no
wonder, when she was acting such a cruel treason!'</p>

<p>'Oh no, Diane would never so treat me,' cried Eustacie.&nbsp; 'I
see how it was!&nbsp; You did not know that my father was latterly
called Marquis de Nid-de-Merle, and when they brought me here, they
WOULD call me after him: they said a maid of honour must be
Demoiselle, and my uncle said there was only one way in which I
could remain Madame de Ribaumont! And the name must have deceived
you.&nbsp; Thou wast always a great dull boy,' she added, with a
sudden assumption of childish intimacy that annihilated the nine
years since their parting.</p>

<p>'Had I seen thee, I had not mistaken for an instant.&nbsp; This
little face stirred my heart; hers repelled me.&nbsp; And she
deceived me wittingly, Eustacie, for I asked after her by
name.'</p>

<p>'Ah, she wished to spare my embarrassment.&nbsp; And then her
brother must have dealt with her.'</p>

<p>'I see,' exclaimed Berenger, 'I am to be palmed off thus that
thou mayest be reserved for Narcisse.&nbsp; Tell me, Eustacie, wast
thou willing?'</p>

<p>'I hate Narcisse!' she cried.&nbsp; 'But oh, I am lingering too
long. &nbsp;Monsieur will make some hateful tale!&nbsp; I never
fell into his way before, my Queen and Madame la Comtesse are so
careful.&nbsp; Only to-day, as I was attending her alone, the King
came and gave her his arm, and I had to drop behind.&nbsp; I must
find her; I shall be missed,' she added, in sudden alarm.&nbsp;
'Oh, what will they say?'</p>

<p>'No blame for being with thy husband,' he answered, clasping her
hand.&nbsp; 'Thou art mine henceforth. I will soon cut our way out
of the web thy treacherous kindred have woven. Meantime---'</p>

<p>'Hush! There are voices,' cried Eustacie in terror, and, guided
by something he could not discern, she fled with the swiftness of a
bird down the alley.&nbsp; Following, with the utmost speed that
might not bear the appearance of pursuit, he found that on coming
to the turn she had moderated her pace, and was more tranquilly
advancing to a bevy of ladies, who sat perched on the stone steps
like great butterflies sunning themselves, watching the game, and
receiving the attentions of their cavaliers.&nbsp; He saw her
absorbed into the group, and then began to prowl round it, in the
alleys, in a tumult of amazement and indignation.&nbsp; He had been
shamefully deceived and cheated, and justice he would have!&nbsp;
He had been deprived of a thing of his own, and he would assert his
right.&nbsp; He had been made to injure and disown the creature he
was bound to protect, and he must console her and compensate to
her, were it only to redeem his honour.&nbsp; He never even thought
whether he loved her; he merely felt furious at the wrong he had
suffered and been made to commit, and hotly bent on recovering what
belonged to him.&nbsp; He might even have plunged down among the
ladies and claimed her as his wife, if the young Abbe de Mericour,
who was two years older than he, and far less of a boy for his
years, had not joined him in his agitated walk.&nbsp; He then
learnt that all the court knew that the daughter of the late
Marquis de Nid-de-Merle, Comte de Ribaumont, was called by his
chief title, but that her marriage to himself had been forgotten by
some and unknown to others, and thus that the first error between
the cousins had not been wonderful in a stranger, since the
Chevalier's daughter had always been Mdlle. de Ribaumont.&nbsp; The
error once made, Berenger's distaste to Diane had been so
convenient that it had been carefully encouraged, and the desire to
keep him at a distance from court and throw him into the background
was accounted for.&nbsp; The Abbe was almost as indignant as
Berenger, and assured him both of his sympathy and his
discretion.</p>

<p>'I see no need for discretion,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'I shall
claim my wife in the face of the sun.'</p>

<p>'Take counsel first, I entreat,' exclaimed Mericour.&nbsp; 'The
Ribaumonts have much influence with the Guise family, and now you
have offended Monsieur.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Where are those traitorous kinsmen?' cried Berenger.</p>

<p>'Fortunately all are gone on an expedition with the Queen-
mother.&nbsp; You will have time to think.&nbsp; I have heard my
brother say no one ever prospered who offended the meanest follower
of the house of Lorraine.'</p>

<p>'I do not want prosperity, I only want my wife.&nbsp; I hope I
shall never see Paris and its deceivers again.'</p>

<p>'Ah! But is it true that you have applied to have the marriage
annulled at Rome?'</p>

<p>'We were both shamefully deceivers.&nbsp; That can be
nothing.'</p>

<p>'A decree of his Holiness: you a Huguenot; she an heiress.&nbsp;
All is against you.&nbsp; My friend, be cautions, exclaimed the
young ecclesiastic, alarmed by his passionate gestures.&nbsp; 'To
break forth now and be accused of brawling in the palace precincts
would be fatal--fatal--most fatal!'</p>

<p>'I am as calm as possible,' returned Berenger.&nbsp; 'I mean to
act most reasonably.&nbsp; I shall stand before the King and tell
him openly how I have been tampered with, demanding my wife before
the whole court.'</p>

<p>'Long before you could get so far the ushers would have dragged
you away for brawling, or for maligning an honour-able
gentlemen.&nbsp; You would have to finish your speech in the
Bastille, and it would be well if even your English friends could
get you out alive.'</p>

<p>'Why, what a place is this!' began Berenger; but again Mericour
entreated him to curb himself; and his English education had taught
him to credit the house of Guide with so much mysterious power and
wickedness, that he allowed himself to be silenced, and promised to
take no open measures till he had consulted the Ambassador.</p>

<p>'He could not obtain another glimpse of Eustacie, and the hours
passed tardily till the break up of the party. Charles could
scarcely release Sidney from his side, and only let him go on
condition that he should join the next day in an expedition to the
hunting chateau of Montpipeau, to which the King seemed to look
forward as a great holiday and breathing time.</p>

<p>When at length the two youths did return, Sir Francis Walsingham
was completely surprised by the usually tractable, well-behaved
stripling, whose praises he had been writing to his old friend,
bursting in on him with the outcry, 'Sir, sir, I entreat your
counsel!&nbsp; I have been foully cozened.'</p>

<p>'Of how much?' said Sir Francis, in a tone of reprobation.</p>

<p>'Of my wife.&nbsp; Of mine honour.&nbsp; Sir, your Excellency, I
crave pardon, if I spoke too hotly,' said Berenger, collecting
himself;</p>

<p>'but it is enough to drive a man to frenzy.'</p>

<p>'Sit down, my Lord de Ribaumont.&nbsp; Take breath, and let me
know what is this coil.&nbsp; What hath thus moved him, Mr.
Sidney?'</p>

<p>'It is as he says, sir,' replied Sidney, who had beard all as
they returned; 'he has been greatly wronged.&nbsp; The Chevalier de
Ribaumont not only writ to propose the separation without the
lady's knowledge, but imposed his own daughter on our friend as the
wife he had not seen since infancy.'</p>

<p>'There, sir,' broke forth Berenger; 'surely if I claim mine own
in the face of day, no man can withhold her from me!'</p>

<p>'Hold!' said Sir Francis. 'What mean this passion, young
sir?&nbsp; Methought you came hither convinced that both the
religion and the habits in which the young lady had been bred up
rendered your infantine contract most unsuitable.&nbsp; What hath
fallen out to make this change in your mind?'</p>

<p>'That I was cheated, sir.&nbsp; The lady who palmed herself off
on me as my wife was a mere impostor, the Chevalier's own
daughter!'</p>

<p>'That may be; but what known you of this other lady?&nbsp; Has
she been bred up in faith or manners such as your parents would
have your wife?'</p>

<p>'She is my wife,' reiterated Berenger.&nbsp; 'My faith is
plighted to her.&nbsp; That is enough for me.'</p>

<p>Sir Francis made a gesture of despair.&nbsp; 'He has seen her, I
suppose,' said he to Sidney.</p>

<p>'Yes truly, sir,' answered Berenger; 'and found that she had
been as greatly deceived as myself.'</p>

<p>'Then mutual consent is wanting,' said the statesman, gravely
musing.</p>

<p>'That is even as I say,' began Berenger, but Walsingham help up
his hand, and desired that he would make his full statement in the
presence of his tutor.&nbsp; Then sounding a little whistle, the
Ambassador despatched a page to request the attendance of Mr.&nbsp;
Adderley, and recommended young Ribaumont in the meantime to
compose himself.</p>

<p>Used to being under authority as Berenger was, the somewhat
severe tone did much to allay his excitement, and remind him that
right and reason were so entirely on his side, that he had only to
be cool and rational to make them prevail.&nbsp; He was thus able
to give a collected and coherent account of his discovery that the
part of his wife had been assumed by her cousin Diane, and that the
signature of both the young pair to the application to the Pope had
been obtained on false pretences.&nbsp; That he had, as Sidney
said, been foully cozened, in both senses of the word, was as clear
as daylight; but he was much angered and disappointed to find that
neither the Ambassador nor his tutor could see that Eustacie's
worthiness was proved by the iniquity of her relation, or that any
one of the weighty reasons for the expediency of dissolving the
marriage was remove.&nbsp; The whole affair had been in such good
train a little before, that Mr. Adderley was much distressed that
it should thus have been crossed, and thought the new phase of
affairs would be far from acceptable at Combe Walwyn.</p>

<p>'Whatever is just and honourable must be acceptable to my
grandfather,' said Berenger.</p>

<p>'Even so,' said Walsingham; 'but it were well to consider
whether justice and honour require you to overthrow the purpose
wherewith he sent you hither.'</p>

<p>'Surely, sir, justice and require me to fulfil a contract to
which the other party is constant,' said Berenger, feeling very
wise and prudent for calling that wistful, indignant creature the
other party.</p>

<p>'That is also true,' said the Ambassador, 'provided she be
constant; but you own that she signed the requisition for the
dissolution.'</p>

<p>'She did so, but under the same deception as myself, and further
mortified and aggrieved at my seeming faithlessness.'</p>

<p>'So it may easily be represented,' muttered Walsingham.</p>

<p>'How, sir?' cried Berenger, impetuously; 'do you doubt her
truth?'</p>

<p>'Heaven forefend,' said Sir Francis, 'that I should discuss any
fair lady's sincerity!&nbsp; The question is how far you are
bound.&nbsp; Have I understood you that you are veritably wedded,
not by a mere contract of espousal?'</p>

<p>'Berenger could produce no documents, for they had been left at
Chateau Leurre, and on his father's death the Chevalier had claimed
the custody of them; but he remembered enough of the ceremonial to
prove that the wedding had been a veritable one, and that only the
papal intervention could annul it.</p>

<p>Indeed an Englishman, going by English law, would own no power
in the Pope, nor any one on earth, to sever the sacred tie of
wedlock; but French courts of law would probably ignore the mode of
application, and would certainly endeavour to separate between a
Catholic and a heretic.</p>

<p>'I am English, sir, in heart and faith,' said Berenger,
earnestly.&nbsp; 'Look upon me as such, and tell me, am I married
or single at this moment?'</p>

<p>'Married assuredly.&nbsp; More's the pity,' said Sir
Francis.</p>

<p>'And no law of God or man divides us without our own
consent.'&nbsp; There was no denying that the mutual consent of the
young pair at their present age was all that was wanting to
complete the inviolability of their marriage contract.</p>

<p>Berenger was indeed only eighteen, and Eustacie more than a year
younger, but there was nothing in their present age to invalidate
their marriage, for persons of their rank were usually wedded quite
as young or younger.&nbsp; Walsingham was only concerned at his old
friend's disappointment, and at the danger of the young man running
headlong into a connection probably no more suitable than that with
Diane de Ribaumont would have been.&nbsp; But it was not convenient
to argue against the expediency of a man's loving his own wife; and
when Berenger boldly declared he was not talking of love but of
justice, it was only possible to insist that he should pause and
see where true justice lay.</p>

<p>And thus the much-perplexed Ambassador broke up the conference
with his hot and angry young guest.</p>

<p>'And Mistress Lucy---?' sighed Mr. Adderley, in rather an <i>
inapropos</i> fashion it must be owned; but then he had been
fretted beyond endurance by his pupil striding up and down his
room, reviling Diane, and describing Eustacie, while he was trying
to write these uncomfortable tidings to Lord Walwyn.</p>

<p>'Lucy!&nbsp; What makes you bring her up to me?' exclaimed
Berenger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Little Dolly would be as much to the purpose!'</p>

<p>'Only, sir, no resident at Hurst Walwyn could fail to know that
has been planned and desired.'</p>

<p>'Pshaw!' cries Berenger; 'have you not heard that it was a mere
figment, and that I could scarce have wedded Lucy safely, even had
this matter gone as you wish?&nbsp; This is the luckiest chance
that could have befallen her.'</p>

<p>'That may be,' said Mr. Adderley; 'I wish she may think
so--sweet young lady!'</p>

<p>'I tell you, Mr. Adderley, you should know better!&nbsp; Lucy
has more sense.&nbsp; My aunt, whom she follows more than any other
creature, ever silenced the very sport or semblance of love
passages between us even as children, by calling them unseemly in
one wedded as I am.&nbsp; Brother and sister we have ever been, and
have loved as such--ay, and shall!&nbsp; I know of late some
schemes have crossed my mother's mind---'</p>

<p>'Yea, and that of others.'</p>

<p>'But they have not ruffled Lucy's quiet nature--trust me! And
for the rest?&nbsp; What doth she need me in comparison of this
poor child?&nbsp; She--like a bit of her own gray lavender in the
shadiest nook of the walled garden, tranquil there--sure not to be
taken there, save to company with fine linen in some trim scented
coffer, whilst this fresh glowing rosebud has grown up pure and
precious in the very midst of the foulest corruption Christendom
can show, and if I snatch her not from it, I, the innocence and
sweetness, what is to be her fate?&nbsp; The very pity of a
Christian, the honour of a gentleman, would urge me, even if it
were not my most urgent duty!'</p>

<p>'Mr. Adderley argued no more.&nbsp; When Berenger came to his
duty in the matter he was invincible, and moreover all the more
provoking, because he mentioned it with a sort of fiery sound of
relish, and looked so very boyish all the time.&nbsp; Poor Mr.
Adderley!' feeling as if his trust were betrayed, loathing the very
idea of a French court lady, saw that his pupil had been allured
into a headlong passion to his own misery, and that of all whose
hopes were set on him, yet preached to by this stripling scholar
about duties and sacred obligations!&nbsp; Well might he rue the
day he ever set foot in Paris.</p>

<p>Then, to his further annoyance, came a royal messenger to invite
the Baron de Ribaumont to join the expedition to Montpipeau.&nbsp;
Of course he must go, and his tutor must be left behind, and who
could tell into what mischief he might not be tempted!</p>

<p>Here, however, Sidney gave the poor chaplain some comfort.&nbsp;
He believed that no ladies were to be of the party, and that the
gentlemen were chiefly of the King's new friends among the
Huguenots, such as Coligny, his son-in-law Teligny, Rochefoucauld,
and the like, among whom the young gentleman could not fall into
any very serious harm, and might very possibly be influenced
against a Roman Catholic wife.&nbsp; At any rate, he would be out
of the way, and unable to take any dangerous steps.</p>

<p>This same consideration so annoyed Berenger that he would have
declined the invitation, if royal invitations could have been
declined.&nbsp; And in the morning, before setting out, he dressed
himself point device, and with Osbert behind him marched down to
the Croix de Larraine, to call upon the Chevalier de
Ribaumont.&nbsp; He had a very fine speech at his tongue's end when
he set out, but a good deal of it had evaporated when he reached
the hotel, and perhaps he was not very sorry not to find the old
gentleman within.</p>

<p>On his return, he indited a note to the Chevalier, explaining
that he had now seen his wife, Madame la Baronne de Ribaumont, and
had come to an understanding with her, by which he found that it
was under a mistake that the application to the Pope had been
signed, and that they should, therefore, follow it up with a
protest, and act as if no such letter had been sent.</p>

<p>Berenger showed this letter to Walsingham, who, though much
concerned, could not forbid his sending it.&nbsp; 'Poor lad,' he
said to the tutor; ''tis an excellently writ billet for one so
young.&nbsp; I would it were in a wiser cause.&nbsp; But he has
fairly the bit between his teeth, and there is no checking him
while he has this show of right on his side.'</p>

<p>And poor Mr. Adderley could only beseech Mr. Sidney to take care
of him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; THE QUEEN'S PASTORAL</h3>

<p>Either very gravely gay,</p>

<p>Or very gaily grave,--W. M. PRAED</p>

<p>Montpipeau, though in the present day a suburb of Paris, was in
the sixteenth century far enough from the city to form a sylvan
retreat, where Charles IX, could snatch a short respite from the
intrigues of his court, under pretext of enjoying his favourite
sport.&nbsp; Surrounded with his favoured associates of the
Huguenot party, he seemed to breathe a purer atmosphere, and to
yield himself up to enjoyment greater than perhaps his sad life had
ever known.</p>

<p>He rode among his gentlemen, and the brilliant cavalcade passed
through poplar-shaded roads, clattered through villages, and
threaded their way through bits of forest still left for the royal
chase.&nbsp; The people thronged out of their houses, and shouted
not only 'Vive le Roy,' but 'Vive l'Amiral,' and more than once the
cry was added, 'Spanish war, or civil war!'&nbsp; The heart of
France was, if not with the Reformed, at least against Spain and
the Lorrainers, and Sidney perceived, from the conversation of the
gentlemen round him, that the present expedition had been devised
less for the sake of the sport, than to enable the King to take
measures for emancipating himself from the thraldom of his mother,
and engaging the country in a war against Philip II.&nbsp; Sidney
listened, but Berenger chafed, feeling only that he was being
further carried out of reach of his explanation with his
kindred.&nbsp; And thus they arrived at Montpipeau, a tower, tall
and narrow, like all French designs, but expanded on the ground
floor by wooden buildings capable of containing the numerous train
of a royal hunter, and surrounded by an extent of waste land,
without fine trees, though with covert for deer, boars, and wolves
sufficient for sport to royalty and death to peasantry. Charles
seemed to sit more erect in his saddle, and to drink in joy with
every breath of the thyme-scented breeze, from the moment his horse
bounded on the hollow-sounding turf; and when he leapt to the
ground, with the elastic spring of youth, he held out his hands to
Sidney and to Teligny, crying 'Welcome, my friends.&nbsp; Here I am
indeed a king!'</p>

<p>It was a lovely summer evening, early in August, and Charles
bade the supper to be spread under the elms that shaded a green
lawn in front of the chateau.&nbsp; Etiquette was here so far
relaxed as to permit the sovereign to dine with his suite, and
tables, chairs, and benches were brought out, drapery festooned in
the trees to keep off sun and wind, the King lay down in the fern
and let his happy dogs fondle him, and as a hers-girl passed along
a vista in the distance, driving her goats before her, Philip
Sidney marvelled whether it was not even thus in Arcadia.</p>

<p>Presently there was a sound of horses trampling, wheels moving,
a party of gaily gilded archers of the guard jingled up, and in
their midst was a coach.&nbsp; Berenger's heart seemed to leap at
once to his lips, as a glimpse of ruffs, hats, and silks dawned on
him through the windows.</p>

<p>The king rose from his lair among the fern, the Admiral stood
forward, all heads were bared, and from the coach-door alighted the
young Queen; no longer pale, subdued, and indifferent, but with a
face shining with girlish delight, as she held out her hand to the
Admiral.&nbsp; 'Ah! This is well, this is beautiful,' she
exclaimed; 'it is like our happy chases in the Tyrol.&nbsp; Ah,
Sire!' to the King, 'how I thank you for letting me be with
you.'</p>

<p>After her Majesty descended her gentleman-usher.&nbsp; Then came
the lady-in-waiting, Madame de Sauve, the wife of the state
secretary in attendance on Charles, and a triumphant, coquettish
beauty, than a fat, good-humoured Austrian dame, always called
Madame la Comtesse, because her German name was unpronounceable,
and without whom the Queen never stirred, and lastly a little
figure, rounded yet slight, slender yet soft and plump, with a
kitten-like alertness and grace of motion, as she sprang out,
collected the Queen's properties of fan, kerchief, pouncet-box,
mantle, &amp;c., and disappeared in to the chateau, without
Berenger's being sure of anything but that her little black hat had
a rose-coloured feather in it.</p>

<p>The Queen was led to a chair placed under one of the largest
trees, and there Charles presented to her such of his gentlemen as
she was not yet acquainted with, the Baron de Ribaumont among the
rest.</p>

<p>'I have heard of M. de Ribaumont,' she said, in a tone that made
the colour mantle in his fair cheek; and with a sign of her hand
she detained him at her side till the King had strolled away with
Madame la Sauve, and no one remained near but her German
countess.&nbsp; Then changing her tone to one of confidence, which
the high-bred homeliness of her Austrian manner rendered
inexpressibly engaging, she said, 'I must apologize, Monsieur, for
the giddiness of my sister-in-law, which I fear caused you some
embarrassment.'</p>

<p>'Ah, Madame,' said Berenger, kneeling on one knee as she
addressed him, and his heart bounding with wild, undefined hope, 'I
cannot be grateful enough.&nbsp; It was that which led to my being
undeceived.'</p>

<p>'It was true, then, that you were mistaken?' said the Queen.</p>

<p>'Treacherously deceived, Madame, by those whose interest it is
to keep us apart,' said Berenger, colouring with indignation; 'they
imposed my other cousin on me as my wife, and caused her to think
me cruelly neglectful.'</p>

<p>'I know,' said the Queen.&nbsp; 'Yet Mdlle. de Ribaumont is far
more admired than my little blackbird.'</p>

<p>'That may be, Madame, but not by me.'</p>

<p>'Yet is it true that you came to break off the marriage?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Madame,' said Berenger, honestly, 'but I had not seen
her.'</p>

<p>'And now?' said the Queen, smiling.</p>

<p>'I would rather die than give her up,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'Oh,
Madame, help us of your grace.&nbsp; Every one is trying to part
us, every one is arguing against us, but she is my own true wedded
wife, and if you will but give her to me, all will be well.'</p>

<p>'I like you, M. de Ribaumont,' said the Queen, looking him full
in the face.&nbsp; 'You are like our own honest Germans at my home,
and I think you mean all you say.&nbsp; I had much rather my dear
little Nid de Merle were with you than left here, to become like
all the others.&nbsp; She is a good little <i>Liegling</i>,--how do
you call it in French? She has told me all, and truly I would help
you with all my heart, but it is not as if I were the
Queen-mother.&nbsp; You must have recourse to the King, who loves
you well, and at my request included you in the hunting-party.'</p>

<p>Berenger could only kiss her hand in token of earnest thanks
before the repast was announced, and the King came to lead her to
the table spread beneath the trees.&nbsp; The whole party supped
together, but Berenger could have only a distant view of his little
wife, looking very demure and grave by the side of the Admiral.</p>

<p>But when the meal was ended, there was a loitering in the
woodland paths, amid healthy openings or glades trimmed into
discreet wildness fit for royal rusticity; the sun set in parting
glory on one horizon, the moon rising in crimson majesty on the
other.&nbsp; A musician at intervals touched the guitar, and sang
Spanish or Italian airs, whose soft or quaint melody came dreamily
through the trees.&nbsp; Then it was that with beating heart
Berenger stole up to the maiden as she stood behind the Queen, and
ventured to whisper her name and clasp her hand.</p>

<p>She turned, their eyes met, and she let him lead her apart into
the wood.&nbsp; It was not like a lover's tryst, it was more like
the continuation of their old childish terms, only that he treated
her as a thing of his own, that he was bound to secure and to
guard, and she received him as her own lawful but tardy protector,
to be treated with perfect reliance but with a certain playful
resentment.</p>

<p>'You will not run away from me now,' he said, making full prize
of her hand and arm.</p>

<p>'Ah! is not she the dearest and best of queens?' and the large
eyes were lifted up to him in such frank seeking of sympathy that
he could see into the depths of their clear darkness.</p>

<p>'It is her doing then.&nbsp; Though, Eustacie, when I knew the
truth, not flood nor fire should keep me long from you, my heart,
my love, my wife.'</p>

<p>'What! wife in spite of those villainous letter?' she said,
trying to pout.</p>

<p>'Wife for ever, inseparably! Only you must be able to swear that
you knew nothing of the one that brought me here.'</p>

<p>'Poor me!&nbsp; No, indeed!&nbsp; There was Celine carried off
at fourteen, Madame de Blanchet a bride at fifteen; all marrying
hither and thither; and I--' she pulled a face irresistibly droll--
'I growing old enough to dress St. Catherine's hair, and wondering
where was M. le Baron.'</p>

<p>'They thought me too young,' said Berenger, 'to take on me the
cares of life.'</p>

<p>'So they were left to me?'</p>

<p>'Cares! What cares have you but finding the Queen's fan?'</p>

<p>'Little you know!' she said, half contemptuous, half
mortified.</p>

<p>'Nay, pardon me, <i>ma mie</i>.&nbsp; Who has troubled you?'</p>

<p>'Ah! you would call it nothing to be beset by Narcisse; to be
told one's husband is faithless, till one half believes it; to be
looked at by ugly eyes; to be liable to be teased any day by
Monsieur, or worse, by that mocking ape, M. d'Alecon, and to have
nobody who can or will hinder it.'</p>

<p>She was sobbing by this time, and he exclaimed, 'Ah, would that
I could revenge all!&nbsp; Never, never shall it be again!&nbsp;
What blessed grace has guarded you through all?'</p>

<p>'Did I not belong to you?' she said exultingly.&nbsp; 'And had
not Sister Monique, yes, and M. le Baron, striven hard to make me
good?&nbsp; Ah, how kind he was!'</p>

<p>'My father?&nbsp; Yes, Eustacie, he loved you to the last.&nbsp;
He bade me, on his deathbed, give you his own Book of Psalms, and
tell you he had always loved and prayed for you.'</p>

<p>'Ah! his Psalms!&nbsp; I shall love them!&nbsp; Even at
Bellaise, when first we came there, we used to sing them, but the
Mother Abbess went out visiting, and when she came back she said
they were heretical.&nbsp; And Soeur Monique would not let me say
the texts he taught me, but I WOULD not forget them.&nbsp; I say
them often in my heart.'</p>

<p>'Then,' he cried joyfully, 'you will willingly embrace my
religion?'</p>

<p>'Be a Huguenot?' she said distastefully.</p>

<p>'I am not precisely a Huguenot; I do not love them,' he answered
hastily; 'but all shall be made clear to you at my home in
England.'</p>

<p>'England!' she said.&nbsp; 'Must we live in England?&nbsp; Away
from every one?'</p>

<p>'Ah, they will love so much! I shall make you so happy there,'
he answered. 'There you will see what it is to be true and
trustworthy.'</p>

<p>'I had rather live at Chateau Leurre, or my own Nid de Merle,'
she replied.&nbsp; 'There I should see Soeur Monique, and my aunt,
the Abbess, and we would have the peasants to dance in the castle
court.&nbsp; Oh! if you could but see the orchards at Le Bocage,
you would never want to go away.&nbsp; And we could come now and
then to see my dear Queen.</p>

<p>'I am glad at least you would not live at court.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no, I have been more unhappy here than ever I knew could be
borne.'</p>

<p>And a very few words from him drew out all that had happened to
her since they parted.&nbsp; Her father had sent her to Bellaise, a
convent founded by the first of the Angevin branch, which was
presided over by his sister, and where Diane was also
educated.&nbsp; The good sister Monique had been mistress of the
<i>pensionnaires</i>, and had evidently taken much pains to keep
her charge innocent and devout.&nbsp; Diane had been taken to court
about two years before, but Eustacie had remained at the convent
till some three months since, when she had been appointed maid of
honour to the recently-married Queen; and her uncle had fetched her
from Anjou, and had informed her at the same time that her young
husband had turned Englishman and heretic, and that after a few
formalities had been complied with, she would become the wife of
her cousin Narcisse.&nbsp; Now there was no person whom she so much
dreaded as Narcisse, and when Berenger spoke of him as a feeble
fop, she shuddered as though she knew him to have something of the
tiger.</p>

<p>'Do you remember Benoit?' she said; 'poor Benoit, who came to
Normandy as my <i>laquais</i>?&nbsp; When I went back to Anjou he
married a girl from Leurre, and went to aid his father at the
farm.&nbsp; The poor fellow had imbibed the Baron's doctrine--he
spread it.&nbsp; It was reported that there was a nest of Huguenots
on the estate.&nbsp; My cousin came to break it up with his <i>gens
d'armes</i> O Berenger, he would hear no entreaties, he had no
mercy; he let them assemble on Sunday, that they might be all
together.&nbsp; He fired the house; shot down those who escaped; if
a prisoner were made, gave him up to the Bishop's Court.&nbsp;
Benoit, my poor good Benoit, who used to lead my palfrey, was first
wounded, then tried, and burnt--burnt in the PLACE at Lucon!&nbsp;
I heard Narcisse laugh--laugh as he talked of the cries of the poor
creatures in the conventicler.&nbsp; My own people, who loved
me!&nbsp; I was but twelve years old, but even then the wretch
would pay me a half-mocking courtesy, as one destined to him; and
the more I disdained him and said I belonged to you, the more both
he and my aunt, the Abbess, smiled, as though they had their bird
in a cage; but they left me in peace till my uncle brought me to
court, and then all began again: and when they said you gave me up,
I had no hope, not even of a convent.&nbsp; But ah, it is all over
now, and I am so happy!&nbsp; You are grown so gentle and so
beautiful, Berenger, and so much taller than I ever figured you to
myself, and you look as if you could take me up in your arms, and
let no harm happen to me.'</p>

<p>'Never, never shall it!' said Berenger, felling all manhood,
strength, and love stir within him, and growing many years in heart
in that happy moment.&nbsp; 'My sweet little faithful wife, never
fear again now you are mine.'</p>

<p>Alas! poor children.&nbsp; They were a good way from the
security they had begun to fancy for themselves.&nbsp; Early the
next morning, Berenger went in his straightforward way to the King,
thanked him, and requested his sanction for at once producing
themselves to the court as Monsieur le Baron and Madame la Baronne
de Ribaumont.</p>

<p>At this Charles swore a great oath, as one in perplexity, and
bade him not go so fast.</p>

<p>'See here,' said he, with the rude expletives only too habitual
with him; 'she is a pretty little girl, and she and her lands are
much better with an honest man like you than with that <i>
pendard</i> of a cousin; but you see he is bent on having her, and
he belongs to a cut-throat crew that halt at nothing.&nbsp; I would
not answer for your life, if you tempted him so strongly to rid
himself of you.'</p>

<p>'My own sword, Sire, can guard my life.'</p>

<p>'Plague upon your sword!&nbsp; What does the foolish youth think
it would do against half-a-dozen poniards and pistols in a lane
black as hell's mouth?'</p>

<p>The foolish young WAS thinking how could a king so full of fiery
words and strange oaths bear to make such an avowal respecting his
own capital and his own courtiers.&nbsp; All he could do was to bow
and reply, 'Nevertheless, Sire, at whatever risk, I cannot
relinquish my wife; I would take her at one to the
Ambassador's.'</p>

<p>'How, sir!' interrupted Charles, haughtily and angrily, 'if you
forget that you are a French nobleman still, I should remember
it!&nbsp; The Ambassador may protect his own countrymen-none
else.'</p>

<p>'I entreat your Majesty's pardon,' said Berenger, anxious to
retract his false step.&nbsp; 'It was your goodness and the
gracious Queen's that made me hope for your sanction.'</p>

<p>'All the sanction Charles de Valois can give is yours, and
welcome,' said the King, hastily.&nbsp; 'The sanction of the King
of France is another matter!&nbsp; To say the truth, I see no way
out of the affair but an elopement.'</p>

<p>'Sire!' exclaimed the astonished Berenger, whose
strictly-disciplined education had little prepared him for such
counsel.</p>

<p>'Look you!&nbsp; if I made you known as a wedded pair, the
Chevalier and his son would not only assassinate you, but down on
me would come my brother, and my mother, and M. de Guise and all
their crew, veritably for giving the prize out of the mouth of
their satellite, but nominally for disregarding the Pope, favouring
a heretical marriage, and I know not what, but, as things go here,
I should assuredly get the worst of it; and if you made safely off
with your prize, no one could gainsay you--I need know nothing
about it--and lady and lands would be your without dispute.&nbsp;
You might ride off from the skirts of the forest; I would lead the
hunt that way, and the three days' riding would bring you to
Normady, for you had best cross to England immediately.&nbsp; When
she is one there, owned by your kindred, Monsieur le cousin may
gnash his teeth as he will, he must make the best of it for the
sake of the honour of his house, and you can safely come back and
raise her people and yours to follow the Oriflamme when it takes
the field against Spain.&nbsp; What! you are still discontented?
Speak out! Plain speaking is a treat not often reserved for
me.'</p>

<p>'Sire, I am most grateful for your kindness, but I should
greatly prefer going straightforward.'</p>

<p>'Peste!&nbsp; Well is it said that a blundering Englishman goes
always right before him!&nbsp; There, then!&nbsp; As your King on
the one hand, as the friend who has brought you and your wife
together, sir, it is my command that you do not compromise me and
embroil greater matters than you can understand by publicly
claiming this girl.&nbsp; Privately I will aid you to the best of
my ability; publicly, I command you, for my sake, if you heed not
your own, to be silent!'</p>

<p>Berenger sought out Sidney, who smiled at his surprise.</p>

<p>'Do you not see,' he said, 'that the King is your friend, and
would be very glad to save the lady's lands from the Guisards, but
that he cannot say so; he can only befriend a Huguenot by
stealth.'</p>

<p>'I would not be such a king for worlds!'</p>

<p>However, Eustacie was enchanted.&nbsp; It was like a prince and
princess in Mere Perinne's fairy tales.&nbsp; Could they go like a
shepherd and shepherdess?&nbsp; She had no fears-no scruples.&nbsp;
Would she not be with her husband?&nbsp; It was the most charming
frolic in the world.&nbsp; So the King seemed to think it, though
he was determined to call it all the Queen's doing-- the first
intrigue of her own, making her like all the rest of us--the
Queen's little comedy.&nbsp; He undertook to lead the chase as far
as possible in the direction of Normandy, when the young pair might
ride on to an inn, meet fresh horses, and proceed to Chateau
Leurre, and thence to England.&nbsp; He would himself provide a
safe-conduct, which, as Berenger suggested, would represent them as
a young Englishman taking home his young wife.&nbsp; Eustacie
wanted at least to masquerade as an Englishwoman, and played off
all the fragments of the language she had caught as a child, but
Berenger only laughed at her, and said they just fitted the French
bride.&nbsp; It was very pretty to laugh at Eustacie; she made such
a droll pretence at pouting with her rosebud lips, and her merry
velvety eyes belied them so drolly.</p>

<p>Such was to be the Queen's pastoral; but when Elisabeth found
the responsibility so entirely thrown on her, she began to look
grave and frightened. &nbsp;It was no doubt much more than she had
intended when she brought about the meeting between the young
people, and the King, who had planned the elopement, seemed still
resolved to make all appear her affair.&nbsp; She looked all day
more like the grave, spiritless being she was at court than like
the bright young rural queen of the evening before, and she was
long in her little oratory chapel in the evening.&nbsp; Berenger,
who was waiting in the hall with the other Huguenot gentlemen,
thought her devotions interminable since they delayed all her
ladies.&nbsp; At length, however, a page came up to him, and said
in a low voice, 'The Queen desires the presence of M. le Baron de
Ribaumont.'</p>

<p>He followed the messenger, and found himself in the little
chapel, before a gaily-adorned altar, and numerous little shrines
and niches round.&nbsp; Sidney would have dreaded a surreptitious
attempt to make him conform, but Berenger had no notion of such
perils,--he only saw that Eustacie was standing by the Queen's
chair, and a kindly-looking Austrian priest, the Queen's confessor,
held a book in his hand.</p>

<p>The Queen came to meet him.&nbsp; 'For my sake,' she said, with
all her sweetness, 'to ease my mind, I should like to see my little
Eustacie made entirely your own ere you go.&nbsp; Father Meinhard
tells me it is safer that, when the parties were under twelve years
old, the troth should be again exchanged.&nbsp; No other ceremony
is needed.'</p>

<p>'I desire nothing but to have her made indissolubly my own,'
said Berenger, bowing.</p>

<p>'And the King permits,' added Elisabeth.</p>

<p>The King growled out, 'It is your comedy, Madame; I meddle
not.'</p>

<p>The Austrian priest had no common language with Berenger but
Latin.&nbsp; He asked a few questions, and on hearing the answers,
declared that the sacrament of marriage had been complete, but
that--as was often done in such cases--he would once more hear the
troth-plight of the young pair.&nbsp; The brief formula was
therefore at once exchanged--the King, when the Queen looked
entreatingly at him, rousing himself to make the bride over to
Berenger.&nbsp; As soon as the vows had been made, in the briefest
manner, the King broke in boisterously:</p>

<p>'There, you are twice marred, to please Madame there; but hold
your tongues all of you about this scene in the play.'</p>

<p>Then almost pushing Eustacie over to Berenger, he added, 'There
she is! Take your wife, sir; but mind, she was as much yours before
as she is now.'</p>

<p>But for all Berenger had said about 'his wife,' it was only now
that he really FELT her his own, and became husband rather than
lover-man instead of boy.&nbsp; She was entirely his own now, and
he only desired to be away with her; but some days' delay was
necessary.&nbsp; A chase on the scale of the one that was to favour
their evasion could not be got up without some notice; and,
moreover, it was necessary to procure money, for neither Sidney nor
Ribaumont had more than enough with them for the needful
liberalities to the King's servants and huntsmen.&nbsp; Indeed
Berenger had spent all that remained in his purse upon the wares of
an Italian pedlar whom he and Eustacie met in the woods, and whose
gloves 'as sweet as fragrant posies,' fans, scent-boxes, pocket
mirrors, Genoa wire, Venice chains, and other toys, afforded him
the mean of making up the gifts that he wished to carry home to his
sisters; and Eustacie's counsel was merrily given in the
choice.&nbsp; And when the vendor began with a meaning smile to
recommend to the young pair themselves a little silver-netted heart
as a love-token, and it turned out that all Berenger's money was
gone, so that it could not be bought without giving up the scented
casket destined for Lucy, Eustacie turned with her sweetest,
proudest smile, and said, 'No, no; I will not have it; what do we
two want with love-tokens now?'</p>

<p>Sidney had taken the youthful and romantic view of the case, and
considered himself to be taking the best possible bare of is young
friend, by enabling him to deal honourably with so charming a
little wife as Eustacie.&nbsp; Ambassador and tutor would doubtless
be very angry; but Sidney could judge for himself of the lady, and
he therefore threw himself into her interests, and sent his servant
back to Paris to procure the necessary sum for the journey of
Master Henry Berenger and Mistress Mary, his wife.&nbsp; Sidney
was, on his return alone to Paris, to explain all to the elders,
and pacify them as best he could; and his servant was already the
bearer of a letter from Berenger that was to be sent at once to
England with Walsingham's dispatches, to prepare Lord Walwyn for
the arrival of the runaways.&nbsp; The poor boy laboured to be
impressively calm and reasonable in his explanation of the
misrepresentation, and of his strong grounds for assuming his
rights, with his persuasion that his wife would readily join the
English church--a consideration that he knew would greatly smooth
the way for her.&nbsp; Indeed, his own position was impregnable:
nobody could blame him for taking his own wife to himself, and he
was so sure of her charms, that he troubled himself very little
about the impression she might make on his kindred.&nbsp; If they
loved her, it was all right; if not, he could take her back to his
own castle, and win fame and honour under the banner of France in
the Low Countries.&nbsp; As the Lucy Thistlewood, she was far too
discreet to feel any disappointment or displeasure; or if she
should, it was her own fault and that of his mother, for all her
life she had known him to be married.&nbsp; So he finished his
letter with a message that the bells should be ready to ring, and
that when Philip heard three guns fired on the coast, he might
light the big beacon pile above the Combe.</p>

<p>Meantime 'the Queen's Pastoral' was much relished by all the
spectators.&nbsp; The state of things was only avowed to Charles,
Elisabeth, and Philip Sidney, and even the last did not know of the
renewed troth which the King chose to treat as such a secret; but
no one had any doubt of the mutual relations of M. de Ribaumont and
Mdlle. de Nid de Merle, and their dream of bliss was like a
pastoral for the special diversion of the holiday of
Montpipeau.&nbsp; The transparency of their indifference in
company, their meeting eyes, their trysts with the secrecy of an
ostrich, were the subjects of constant amusement to the elders,
more especially as the shyness, blushes, and caution were much more
on the side of the young husband than on that of the lady.&nbsp;
Fresh from her convent, simple with childishness and innocence, it
was to her only the natural completion of her life to be altogether
Berenger's, and the brief concealment of their full union added a
certain romantic enchantment, which added to her exultation in her
victory over her cruel kindred.&nbsp; She had been upon her own
mind, poor child, for her few weeks of court life.&nbsp; She had
been upon her own mind, poor child, for her few weeks of court
life, but not long enough to make her grow older, though just so
long as to make the sense of her having her own protector with her
doubly precious.&nbsp; He, on the other hand, though full of
happiness, did also feel constantly deepening on him the sense of
the charge and responsibility he had assumed, hardly knowing
how.&nbsp; The more dear Eustacie became to him, the more she
rested on him and became entirely his, the more his boyhood and
INSOUCIANCE drifted away behind him; and while he could hardly bear
to heave his darling a moment out of his sight, the less he could
endure any remark or jest upon his affection for her.&nbsp; His
home had been a refined one, where Cecile's convent purity seemed
to diffuse an atmosphere of modest reserve such as did not prevail
in the court of the Maiden Queen herself, and the lad of eighteen
had not seem enough of the outer world to have rubbed off any of
that grace. His seniority to his little wife seemed to show itself
chiefly in his being put out of countenance for her, when she was
too innocent and too proud of her secret matronhood to understand
or resent the wit.</p>

<p>Little did he know that this was the ballet-like interlude in a
great and terrible tragedy, whose first act was being played out on
the stage where they schemed and sported, like their own little
drama, which was all the world to them, and noting to the
others.&nbsp; Berenger knew indeed that the Admiral was greatly
rejoiced that the Nid de Merle estates should go into Protestant
hands, and that the old gentleman lost no opportunity of impressing
on him that they were a heavy trust, to be used for the benefit of
'the Religion,' and for the support of the King in his better
mind.&nbsp; But it may be feared that he did not give a very
attentive ear to all this.&nbsp; He did not like to think of those
estates; he would gladly have left them all the Narcisse, so that
he might have their lady, and though quite willing to win his spurs
under Charles and Coligny against the Spaniard, his heart and head
were far too full to take in the web of politics.&nbsp; Sooth to
say, the elopement in prospect seemed to him infinitely more
important than Pope or Spaniard, Guise or Huguenot, and Coligny
observed with a sigh to Teligny that he was a good boy, but nothing
but the merest boy, with eyes open only to himself.</p>

<p>When Charles undertook to rehearse their escape with them, and
the Queen drove out in a little high-wheeled litter with Mme. la
Comtesse, while Mme. De Sauve and Eustacie were mounted on gay
palfreys with the pommelled side-saddle lately invented by the
Queen-mother, Berenger, as he watched the fearless horsemanship and
graceful bearing of his newly-won wife, had no speculations to
spend on the thoughtful face of the Admiral.&nbsp; And when at the
outskirts of the wood the King's bewildering hunting-horn--sounding
as it were now here, now there, now low, now high--called every
attendant to hasten to its summons, leaving the young squire and
damsel errant with a long winding high-banked lane before them,
they reckoned the dispersion to be all for their sakes, and did not
note, as did Sidney's clear eye, that when the entire company had
come straggling him, it was the King who came up with Mme. De Sauve
almost the last; and a short space after, as if not to appear to
have been with him, appeared the Admiral and his son-in-law.</p>

<p>Sidney also missed one of the Admiral's most trusted attendants,
and from this and other symptoms he formed his conclusions that the
King had scattered his followers as much for the sake of an
unobserved conference with Coligny as for the convenience of the
lovers, and that letters had been dispatched in consequence of that
meeting.</p>

<p>Those letters were indeed of a kind to change the face of
affairs in France.&nbsp; Marshal Strozzi, then commanding in the
south-west, was bidden to embark at La Rochelle in the last week of
August, to hasten to the succour of the Prince of Orange against
Spain, and letters were dispatched by Coligny to all the Huguenot
partisans bidding them assemble at Melun on the third of September,
when they would be in the immediate neighbourhood of the court,
which was bound for Fontainebleau.&nbsp; Was the star of the Guises
indeed waning?&nbsp; Was Charles about to escape from their hands,
and commit himself to an honest, high-minded policy, in which he
might have been able to purify his national Church, and wind back
to her those whom her corruptions had driven to seek truth and
morality beyond her pale?</p>

<p>Alas! there was a bright pair of eyes that saw more than Philip
Sidney's, a pair of ears that heard more, a tongue and pen less
faithful to guard a secret.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<i>.&nbsp; 'LE BROUILON'</i></h3>

<p>But never more the same two sister pearls</p>

<p>Ran down the silken thread to kiss each other.--Tennyson</p>

<p>Berenger was obliged to crave permission from the King to spend
some hours in riding with Osbert to the first hostel on their way,
to make arrangements for the relay of horses that was to meet them
there, and for the reception of Veronique, Eustacie's maid, who was
to be sent off very early in the morning on a pillion behind
Osbert, taking with her the articles of dress that would be wanted
to change her mistress from the huntress maid of honour to the
English dame.</p>

<p>It was not long after he had been gone that a sound of wheels
and trampling horses was heard in one of the forest drives.&nbsp;
Charles, who was amusing himself with shooting at a mark together
with Sidney and Teligny, handed his weapon to an attendant, and
came up with looks of restless anxiety to his Queen, who was placed
in her chair under the tree, with the Admiral and her ladies round
her, as judges of the prize.</p>

<p>'Here is <i>le brouillon</i>,' he muttered.&nbsp; 'I thought we
had been left in peace too long.'</p>

<p>Elisabeth, who Brantome says was water, while her husband was
fire, tried to murmur some hopeful suggestion; and poor little
Eustacie, clasping her hands, could scarcely refrain from uttering
the cry, 'Oh, it is my uncle!&nbsp; Do not let him take me!'</p>

<p>The next minute there appeared four horses greatly heated and
jaded, drawing one of the court coaches; and as it stopped at the
castle gate, two ladies became visible within it--the portly form
of Queen Catherine, and on the back seat the graceful figure of
Diane de Ribaumont.</p>

<p>Charles swore a great oath under his breath.&nbsp; He made a
step forward, but then his glance falling on Eustacie's face, which
had flushed to the rosiest hue of the carnation, he put his finger
upon his lip with a menacing air, and then advanced to greet his
mother, followed by his gentlemen.</p>

<p>'Fear not, my dear child,' said the young Queen, taking
Eustacie's arm as she rose for the same purpose.&nbsp; 'Obey the
King, and he will take care that all goes well.'</p>

<p>The gentle Elisabeth was, however, the least regarded member of
the royal family.&nbsp; Her mother-in-law had not even waited to
greet her, but had hurried the King into his cabinet, with a
precipitation that made the young Queen's tender heart conclude
that some dreadful disaster had occurred, and before Mademoiselle
de Ribaumont had had time to make her reverence, she exclaimed,
breathlessly, 'Oh, is it ill news?&nbsp; Not from Vienna?'</p>

<p>'No, no, Madame; reassure yourself,' replied Diane; 'it is
merely that her Majesty, being on the way to Monceaux with
Mesdames, turned out of her road to make a flying visit to your
graces, and endeavour to persuade you to make her party
complete.'</p>

<p>Elisabeth looked as if questioning with herself if this would
possibly be the whole explanation.&nbsp; Monceaux was a castle
belonging to the Queen Dowager at no great distance from
Montpipeau, but there had been no intention of leaving Paris before
the wedding, which was fixed for the seventeenth of August, and the
bridegroom was daily expected.&nbsp; She asked who was the party at
Monceaux, and was told that Madame de Nemours had gone thither the
evening before, with her son, M. de Guise, to make ready; and that
Monsieur was escorting thither his two sisters, Madame de Lorraine
and Madame Marguerite.&nbsp; The Queen-mother had set out before
them very early in the morning.</p>

<p>'You must have made great speed,' said Elisabeth; 'it is
scarcely two o'clock.'</p>

<p>'Truly we did, Madame; two of our horses even died upon the
road; but the Queen was anxious to find the King ere he should set
off on one of his long chases.'</p>

<p>Diane, at every spare moment, kept her eyes interrogatively
fixed on her cousin, and evidently expected that the taciturn
Queen, to whom a long conversation, in any language but Spanish,
was always a grievance, would soon dismiss them both; and Eustacie
did not know whether to be thankful or impatient, as Elisabeth,
with tardy, hesitating, mentally-translated speech, inquired into
every circumstance of the death of the poor horses, and then into
all the court gossip, which she was currently supposed neither to
hear nor understand; and then bethought herself that this good
Mademoiselle de Ribaumont could teach her that embroidery stitch
she had so long wished to learn.&nbsp; Taking her arm, she entered
the hall, and produced her work, so as effectually to prevent any
communication between the cousins; Eustacie, meanwhile her heart
clinging to her friend, felt her eyes filling with tears at the
thoughts of how unkind her morrow's flight would seem without one
word of farewell or of confidence, and was already devising tokens
of tenderness to be left behind for Diane's consolation, when the
door of the cabinet opened, and Catherine sailed down the stairs,
with her peculiar gliding step and sweep of dignity.&nbsp; The King
followed her with a face of irresolution and distress.&nbsp; He was
evidently under her displeasure; but she advanced to the young
Queen with much graciousness, and an air of matronly
solicitude.</p>

<p>'My daughter,' she said, 'I have just assured the King that I
cannot leave you in these damp forests.&nbsp; I could not be
responsible for the results of the exposure any longer.&nbsp; It is
for him to make his own arrangements, but I brought my coach empty
on purpose to transport you and your ladies to Monceaux.</p>

<p>The women may follow with the mails.&nbsp; You can be ready as
soon as the horses are harnessed.'</p>

<p>Elisabeth was used to passiveness.&nbsp; She turned one
inquiring look to her husband, but he looked sullen, and, evidently
cowed by his mother, uttered not a word. She could only submit, and
Catherine herself add that there was room for Madame de Sauve and
Mademoiselle de Nid de Merle.&nbsp; Madame la Comtesse should
follow!&nbsp; It was self-evident that propriety would not admit of
the only demoiselle being left behind among the gentlemen.&nbsp;
Poor Eustacie, she looked mutely round as if she hoped to
escape!&nbsp; What was the other unkindness to this?&nbsp; And ever
under the eyes of Diane too, who followed her to their chamber,
when she went to prepare, so that she could not even leave a token
for him where he would have been most certain to find it. Moments
were few; but at the very last, while the queens were being handed
in the carriage, she caught the eye of Philip Sidney.&nbsp; He saw
the appealing look, and came near.&nbsp; She tried to laugh.&nbsp;
'Here is my gage, Monsieur Sidney,' she said, and held out a
rose-coloured knot of ribbon; then, as he came near enough, she
whispered imploringly three of her few English words--</p>

<p>'Give to HIM.'</p>

<p>'I take the gage as it is meant,' said Sidney, putting a knee to
the ground, and kissing the trembling fingers, ere he handed her
into the carriage.&nbsp; He smiled and waved his hand as he met her
earnest eyes.&nbsp; One bow contained a scrap of paper pricked with
needle-holes.&nbsp; Sidney would not have made out those pricks for
the whole world, even had he been able to do more than hastily
secure the token, before the unhappy King, with a paroxysm of
violent interjections, demanded of him whether the Queen of
England, woman though she were, ever were so beset, and never
allowed a moment to herself; then, without giving time for an
answer, he flung away to his cabinet, and might be heard pacing up
and down there in a tempest of perplexity.&nbsp; He came forth only
to order his horse, and desire M. de Sauve and a few grooms to be
ready instantly to ride with him.&nbsp; His face was full of
pitiable perplexity--the smallest obstacle was met with a savage
oath; and he was evidently in all the misery of a weak yet
passionate nature, struggling with impotent violence against a yoke
that evidently mastered it.</p>

<p>He flung a word to his guests that he should return ere night,
and they thus perceived that he did not intend their dismissal.</p>

<p>'Poor youth,' said Coligny, mildly, 'he will be another being
when we have him in our camp with the King of Navarre for his
companion.'</p>

<p>And then the Admiral repaired to his chamber to write one of his
many fond letters to the young wife of his old age; while his
son-in-law and Philip Sidney agreed to ride on, so as to met poor
young Ribaumont, and prepare him for the blow that had befallen him
personally, while they anxiously debated what this sudden descent
of the Queen-mother might portend.&nbsp; Teligny was ready to
believe in any evil intention on her part, but he thought himself
certain of the King's real sentiments, and in truth Charles had
never treated any man with such confidence as this young Huguenot
noble, to whom he had told his opinion of each of his counsellors,
and his complete distrust of all.&nbsp; That pitying affection
which clings to those who cling to it, as well as a true French
loyalty of heart, made Teligny fully believe that however Catherine
might struggle to regain her ascendancy, and whatever apparent
relapses might be caused by Charles's habitual subjection to her,
yet the high aspirations and strong sense of justice inherent in
the King were asserting themselves as his youth was passing into
manhood; and that the much-desired war would enable him to develop
all his higher qualities.&nbsp; Sidney listened, partially agreed,
talked of caution, and mused within himself whether violence might
not sometimes be mistaken for vigour.</p>

<p>Ere long, the merry cadence of an old English song fell with a
homelike sound upon Sidney's ear, and in another moment they were
in sight of Berenger, trotting joyously along, with a bouquet of
crimson and white heather-blossoms in his hand, and his bright
young face full of exultation in his arrangements.&nbsp; He shouted
gaily as he saw them, calling out, 'I thought I should meet
you!&nbsp; but I wondered not to have heard the King's
bugle-horn.&nbsp; Where are the rest of the hunters?'</p>

<p>'Unfortunately we have had another sort of hunt to-day,' said
Sidney, who had ridden forward to meet him; 'and one that I fear,
will disquiet you greatly.'</p>

<p>'How!&nbsp; Not her uncle?' exclaimed Berenger.</p>

<p>'No, cheer up, my friend, it was not she who was the object of
the chase; it was this unlucky King,' he added, speaking English,
'who has been run to earth by his mother.'</p>

<p>'Nay, but what is that to me?' said Berenger, with impatient
superiority to the affairs of the nation.&nbsp; 'How does it touch
us?'</p>

<p>Sidney related the abstraction of the young Queen and her
ladies, and then handed over the rose-coloured token, which
Berenger took with vehement ardour; then his features quivered as
he read the needle-pricked words-two that he had playfully insisted
on her speaking and spelling after him in his adopted tongue, then
not vulgarized, but the tenderest in the language, 'Sweet
heart.'&nbsp; That was all, but to him they conveyed constancy to
him and his, whatever might betide, and an entreaty not to leave
her to her fate.</p>

<p>'My dearest! never!' he muttered; then turning hastily as he put
the precious token into his bosom, he exclaimed, 'Are their women
yet gone?' and being assured that they were not departed when the
two friends had set out, he pushed his horse on at speed, so as to
be able to send a reply by Veronique.&nbsp; He was barely in time:
the clumsy wagon-like conveyance of the waiting-women stood at the
door of the castle, in course of being packed with the Queen's
wardrobe, amid the janglings of lackeys, and expostulating cries of
<i>femmes de chambre</i>, all in the worst possible humour at being
crowded up with their natural enemies, the household of the
Queen-mother.</p>

<p>Veronique, a round-faced Angevin girl--who, like her lady, had
not parted with all her rustic simplicity and honesty, and who had
been necessarily taken into their confidence--was standing apart
from the whirl of confusion, holding the leashes of two or three
little dogs that had been confided to her care, that their keepers
might with more ease throw themselves into the <i>melee</i>.&nbsp;
Her face lighted up as she saw the Baron de Ribaumont arrive.</p>

<p>'Ah, sir, Madame will be so happy that I have seen Monsieur once
more,' she exclaimed under her breath, as he approached her.</p>

<p>'Alas! there is not a moment to write,' he said, looking at the
vehicle, already fast filling, 'but give her these flowers; they
were gathered for her; give her ten thousand thanks for her
token.&nbsp; Tell her to hold firm, and that neither king nor
queen, bolt nor bar, shall keep me from her.&nbsp; Tell her, our
watchword is HOPE.'</p>

<p>The sharp eyes of the duenna of the Queen's household, a rigid
Spanish dame, were already searching for stray members of her
flock, and Veronique had to hurry to her place, while Berenger
remained to hatch new plans, each wilder than the last, and torment
himself with guesses whether his project had been discovered.&nbsp;
Indeed, there were moments when he fancied the frustration of his
purpose the special object of Queen Catherine's journey, but he had
the wisdom to keep any such suggestion to himself.</p>

<p>The King came back by supper-time, looking no longer in a state
of indecision, but pale and morose.&nbsp; He spoke to no one as he
entered, and afterwards took his place at the head of the
supper-table in silence, which he did not break till the meal was
nearly over.&nbsp; Then he said abruptly, 'Gentlemen, our party has
been broken up, and I imagine that after our great hunt tomorrow,
no one will have any objection to return to Paris.&nbsp; We shall
have merrier sport at Fontainebleau when this most troublesome of
weddings is over.'</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but to bow acquiescence, and the
King again became grimly silent.&nbsp; After supper he challenged
Coligny to a game of chess, and not a word passed during the
protracted contest, either from the combatants or any other person
in the hall.&nbsp; It was as if the light had suddenly gone out to
others besides the disappointed and anxious Berenger, and a dull
shadow had fallen on the place only yesterday so lively, joyous,
and hopeful.</p>

<p>Berenger, chained by the etiquette of the royal presence, sat
like a statue, his back against the wall, his arms crossed on his
breast, his eyes fixed, chewing the cud of the memories of his
dream of bliss, or striving to frame the future to his will, and to
decide what was the next reasonable step he could take, or whether
his irrepressible longing to ride straight off to Monceaux, claim
his wife, and take her on horseback behind him, were a mere
impracticable vision.</p>

<p>The King, having been checkmated twice out of three times by the
Admiral, too honest a man not truly to accept his declaration of
not wanting courtly play, pushed away the board, and was attended
by them all to his <i>coucher</i>, which was usually made in
public; and the Queen being absent, the gentlemen were required to
stand around him till he was ready to fall asleep.&nbsp; He did not
seem disposed to talk, but begged Sidney to fetch his lute, and
sing to him some English airs that had taken his fancy much when
sung by Sidney and Berenger together.</p>

<p>Berenger felt as if they would choke him in his present turbid
state of resentful uncertainty; but even as the unhappy young King
spoke, it was with a heavy, restless groan, as he added, 'If you
know any lullaby that will give rest to a wretch tormented beyond
bearing, let us have it.'</p>

<p>'Alas, Sire!' said the Admiral, seeing that no perilous ears
remained in the room; 'there are better and more soothing words
than any mundane melody.'</p>

<p>'<i>Peste</i>!&nbsp; My good father,' said the King, petulantly,
'has not old Philpot, my nurse, rocked me to the sound of your
Marot's Psalms, and crooned her texts over me? I tell you I do not
want to think.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I want what will drive thought away--to dull---'</p>

<p>'Alas! what dulls slays,' said the Admiral.</p>

<p>'Let it.&nbsp; Nothing can be worse than the present,' said the
wretched Charles; then, as if wishing to break away from Coligny,
he threw himself round towards Berenger, and said, 'Here; stoop
down, Ribaumont; a word with you.&nbsp; Your matters have gone up
the mountains, as the Italians say, with mine.&nbsp; But never
fear.&nbsp; Keep silence, and you shall have the bird in your hand,
only you must be patient.&nbsp; Hold! I will make you and Monsieur
Sidney gentlemen of my bed-chamber, which will give you the <i>
entree</i> of the Louvre; and if you cannot get her out of it
without an <i>eclat</i>, then you must be a much duller fellow than
half my court.&nbsp; Only that it is not their own wives that they
abstract.</p>

<p>With this Berenger must needs content himself; and the certainty
of the poor King's good-will did enable him to do his part with
Sidney in the songs that endeavoured to soothe the torments of the
evil spirit which had on that day effected a fresh lodgement in
that weak, unwilling heart.</p>

<p>It was not till the memoirs of the secret actors in this tragedy
were brought to light that the key to these doings was
discovered.&nbsp; M. de Sauve, Charles's secretary, had disclosed
his proceedings to his wife; she, flattered by the attentions of
the Duke of Anjou, betrayed them to him; and the Queen-mother,
terrified at the change of policy, and the loss of the power she
had enjoyed for so many years, had hurried to the spot.</p>

<p>Her influence over her son resembled the fascination of a
snake:</p>

<p>once within her reach he was unable to resist her; and when in
their <i>tete-a-tete</i> she reproached him with ill-faith towards
her, prophesied the overthrow of the Church, the desertion of his
allies, the ruin of his throne, and finally announced her intention
of hiding her head in her own hereditary estates in Auvergne,
begging, as a last favour, that he would give his brother time to
quit France instead of involving him in his own ruin, the poor
young man's whole soul was in commotion.&nbsp; His mother knew her
strength, left the poison to work, and withdrew in displeasure to
Monceaux, sure that, as in effect happened, he would not be long in
following her, imploring her not to abandon him, and making an
unconditional surrender of himself, his conscience, and his friends
into her hands.&nbsp; Duplicity was so entirely the element of the
court, that, even while thus yielding himself, it was as one
checked, but continuing the game; he still continued his connection
with the Huguenots, hoping to succeed in his aims by some future
counter-intrigue; and his real hatred of the court policy, and the
genuine desire to make common cause with them, served his mother's
purpose completely, since his cajolery thus became sincere.&nbsp;
Her purpose was, probably, not yet formed.&nbsp; It was power that
she loved, and hoped to secure by the intrigues she had played off
all her life; but she herself was in the hands of an infinitely
more bloodthirsty and zealous faction, who could easily accomplish
their ends by working on the womanly terrors of an unscrupulous
mind.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.&nbsp; THE WEDDING WITH CRIMSON FAVOURS</h3>

<p>And trust me not at all or all in all.--TENNYSON</p>

<p>So extensive was the Louvre, so widely separated the different
suites of apartments, that Diane and Eustacie had not met after the
pall-mall party till they sat opposite to their several queens in
the coach driving through the woods, the elder cousin curiously
watching the eyes of the younger, so wistfully gazing at the
window, and now and then rapidly winking as though to force back a
rebellious tear.</p>

<p>The cousins had been bred up together in the convent at
Bellaise, and had only been separated by Diane's having been
brought to court two years sooner than Eustacie.&nbsp; They had
always been on very kindly, affectionate terms; Diane treating her
little cousin with the patronage of an elder sister, and greatly
contributing to shield her from the temptations of the court.&nbsp;
The elder cousin was so much the more handsome, brilliant, and
admired, that no notion of rivalry had crossed her mind; and
Eustacie's inheritance was regarded by her as reserved for her
brother, and the means of aggrandizement an prosperity for herself
and her father.&nbsp; She looked upon the child as a sort of piece
of property of the family, to be guarded and watched over for her
brother; and when she had first discovered the error that the young
baron was making between the two daughters of the house, it was
partly in kindness to Eustacie, partly to carry out her father's
plans, and partly from her own pleasure in conversing with anything
so candid and fresh as Berenger, that she had maintained the
delusion.&nbsp; Her father believed himself to have placed Berenger
so entirely in the background, that he would hardly be at court
long enough to discover the imposition; and Diane was not devoid of
a strong hope of winning his affection and bending his will so as
to induce him to become her husband, and become a French courtier
for her sake--a wild dream, but a better castle in the air than she
had ever yet indulged in.</p>

<p>This arrangement was, however, disconcerted by the King's
passion for Sidney's society, which brought young Ribaumont also to
court; and at the time of the mischievous introduction by Madame
Marguerite, Diane had perceived that the mistake would soon be
found out, and that she should no longer be able to amuse herself
with the fresh-coloured, open-faced boy who was unlike all her
former acquaintance; but the magnetism that shows a woman when she
produces an effect had been experienced by her, and she had been
sure that a few efforts more would warm and mould the wax in her
fingers.&nbsp; That he should prefer a little brown thing, whose
beauty was so inferior to her own, had never crossed her mind; she
did not even know that he was invited to the pall-mall party, and
was greatly taken by surprise when her father sought an interview
with her, accused her of betraying their interests, and told her
that this foolish young fellow declared that he had been mistaken,
and having now discovered his veritable wife, protested against
resigning her.</p>

<p>By that time the whole party were gone to Montpipeau, but that
the Baron was among them was not known at the Louvre until Queen
Catherine, who had always treated Diane as rather a favoured,
quick-witted <i>protegee</i>, commanded her attendance, and on her
way let her know that Madame de Sauve had reported that, among all
the follies that were being perpetrated at the hunting-seat, the
young Queen was absolutely throwing the little Nid-de-Merle into
the arms of her Huguenot husband, and that if measures were not
promptly taken all the great estates in the Bocage would be lost to
the young Chevalier, and be carried over to the Huguenot
interest.</p>

<p>Still Diane could not believe that it was so much a matter of
love as that the young had begun to relish court favour and to
value the inheritance, and she could quite believe her little
cousin had been flattered by a few attentions that had no meaning
in them.&nbsp; She was not prepared to find that Eustacie shrank
from her, and tried to avoid a private interview.&nbsp; In truth,
the poor child had received such injunctions from the Queen, and so
stern a warning look from the King, that she durst not utter a
syllable of the evening that had sealed her lot, and was so happy
with her secret, so used to tell everything to Diane, so longing to
talk of her husband, that she was afraid of betraying herself if
once they were alone together.&nbsp; Yet Diane, knowing that her
father trusted to her to learn how far things had gone, and piqued
at seeing the transparent little creature, now glowing and smiling
with inward bliss, now pale, pensive, sighing, and anxious, and
scorning her as too childish for the love that she seemed to
affect, was resolved on obtaining confidence from her.</p>

<p>And when the whole female court had sat down to the silk
embroidery in which Catherine de Medicis excelled, Diane seated
herself in the recess of a window and beckoned her cousin to her
side, so that it was not possible to disobey.</p>

<p>'Little one,' she said, 'why have you cast off your poor
cousin?&nbsp; There, sit down'--for Eustacie stood, with her silk
in her hand, as if meaning instantly to return to her former place;
and now, her cheeks in a flame, she answered in an indignant
whisper, 'You know, Diane!&nbsp; How could you try to keep him from
me?'</p>

<p>'Because it was better for thee, my child, than to be pestered
with an adventurer,' she said, smiling, though bitterly.</p>

<p>'My husband!' returned Eustacie proudly.</p>

<p>'Bah!&nbsp; You know better than that!'&nbsp; Then, as Eustacie
was about to speak, but checked herself, Diane added, 'Yes, my poor
friend, he has a something engaging about him, and we all would
have hindered you from the pain and embarrassment of a meeting with
him.'</p>

<p>Eustacie smiled a little saucy smile, as though infinitely
superior to them all.</p>

<p>'<i>Pauvre petite</i>,' said Diane, nettled; 'she actually
believes in his love.'</p>

<p>'I will not hear a word against my husband!' said Eustacie,
stepping back, as if to return to her place, but Diane rose and
laid her hand on hers.&nbsp; 'My dear,' she said, 'we must not part
thus.&nbsp; I only wish to know what touches my darling so
nearly.&nbsp; I thought she loved and clung to us; why should she
have turned from me for the sake of one who forgot her for half his
life?&nbsp; What can he have done to master this silly little
heart?'</p>

<p>'I cannot tell you, Diane,' said Eustacie, simply; and though
she looked down, the colour on her face was more of a happy glow
than a conscious blush.&nbsp; 'I love him too much; only we
understand each other now, and it is of no use to try to separate
us.'</p>

<p>'Ah, poor little thing, so she thinks,' said Diane; and as
Eustacie again smiled as one incapable of being shaken in her
conviction, she added, 'And how do you know that he loves you?'</p>

<p>Diane was startled by the bright eyes that flashed on her and
the bright colour that made Eustacie perfectly beautiful, as she
answered, 'Because I am his wife!&nbsp; That is enough!'&nbsp;
Then, before her cousin could speak again, 'But, Diane, I promised
not to speak of it.&nbsp; I know he would despise me if I broke my
word, so I will not talk to you till I have leave to tell you all,
and I am going back to help Gabrielle de Limeuil with her
shepherdess.'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Ribaumont felt her attempt most unsatisfactory,
but she knew of old that Eustacie was very determined--all Bellaise
know that to oppose the tiny Baronne was to make her headstrong in
her resolution; and if she suspected that she was coaxed, she only
became more obstinate.&nbsp; To make any discoveries, Diane must
take the line of most cautious caresses, such as to throw her
cousin off her guard; and this she was forced to confess to her
father when he sought an interview with her on the day of her
return to Paris.&nbsp; He shook his head.&nbsp; She must be on the
watch, he said, and get quickly into the silly girl's
confidence.&nbsp; What! had she not found out that the young
villain had been on the point of eloping with her?&nbsp; If such a
thing as that should succeed, the whole family was lost, and she
was the only person who could prevent it.&nbsp; He trusted to
her.</p>

<p>The Chevalier had evidently come to regard his niece as his
son's lawful property, and the Baron as the troublesome meddler;
and Diane had much the same feeling, enhanced by sore jealousy at
Eustacie's triumph over her, and curiosity as to whether it could
be indeed well founded.&nbsp; She had an opportunity of judging the
same evening--mere habit always caused Eustacie to keep under her
wing, if she could not be near the Queen, whenever there was a
reception, and to that reception of course Berenger came, armed
with his right as gentleman of the bedchamber.&nbsp; Eustacie was
colouring and fluttering, as if by the instinct of his presence,
even before the tall fair head became visible, moving forward as
well as the crowd would permit, and seeking about with anxious
eyes.&nbsp; The glances of the blue and the black eyes met at last,
and a satisfied radiance illuminated each young face; then the
young man steered his way through the throng, but was caught midway
by Coligny, and led up to be presented to a hook-nosed,
dark-haired, lively-looking young man, in a suit of black richly
laced with silver.&nbsp; It was the King of Navarre, the royal
bridegroom, who had entered Paris in state that afternoon.&nbsp;
Eustacie tried to be proud of the preferment, but oh! she thought
it mistimed, and was gratified to mark certain wandering of the eye
even while the gracious King was speaking.&nbsp; Then the Admiral
said something that brought the girlish rosy flush up to the very
roots of the short curls of flaxen hair, and made the young King's
white teeth flash out in a mirthful, good-natured laugh, and
thereupon the way opened, and Berenger was beside the two ladies,
kissing Eustacie's hand, but merely bowing to Diane.</p>

<p>She was ready to take the initiative.</p>

<p>'My cousins deem me unpardonable,' she said; 'yet I am going to
purchase their pardon.&nbsp; See this cabinet of porcelain <i>a le
Reine</i>, and Italian vases and gems, behind this curtain.&nbsp;
There is all the siege of Troy, which M. le Baron will not doubt
explain to Mademoiselle, while I shall sit on this cushion, and
endure the siege of St. Quentin from the <i>bon</i> Sieur de
Selinville.'</p>

<p>Monsieur de Selinville was the court bore, who had been in every
battle from Pavia to Montcontour, and gave as full memoirs of each
as did Blaise de Monluc, only <i>viva voce</i>&nbsp; instead of in
writing.&nbsp; Diane was rather a favourite of his; she knew her
way through all his adventures.&nbsp; So soon as she had heard the
description of the King of Navarre's entry into Paris that
afternoon, and the old gentleman's lamentation that his own two
nephews were among the three hundred Huguenot gentleman who had
formed the escort, she had only to observe whether his
reminiscences had gone to Italy or to Flanders in order to be able
to put in the appropriate remarks at each pause, while she listened
all the while to the murmurs behind the curtain.&nbsp; Yet it was
not easy, with all her court breeding, to appear indifferent, and
solely absorbed in hearing of the bad lodgings that had fallen to
the share of the royal troops at Brescia, when such sounds were
reaching her.&nbsp; It was not so much the actual words she heard,
though these were the phrases--'-<i>mon ange</i>, my heart, my
love;' those were common, and Diane had lived in the Queen-mother's
squadron long enough to despise those who uttered them only less
than those who believed them.&nbsp; It was the full depth of
tenderness and earnestness, in the subdued tones of the voice, that
gave her a sense of quiet force and reality beyond all she had ever
known.&nbsp; She had heard and overheard men pour out frantic
ravings of passion, but never had listened to anything like the
sweet protecting tenderness of voice that seemed to embrace and
shelter its object.&nbsp; Diane had no doubts now; he had never so
spoken to her; nay, perhaps he had had no such cadences in his
voice before.&nbsp; It was quite certain that Eustacie was
everything to him, she herself nothing; she who might have had any
gallant in the court at her feet, but had never seen one whom she
could believe in, whose sense of esteem had been first awakened by
this stranger lad who despised her.&nbsp; Surely he was loving this
foolish child simply as his duty; his belonging, as his right he
might struggle hard for her, and if he gained her, be greatly
disappointed; for how could Eustacie appreciate him, little
empty-headed, silly thing, who would be amused and satisfied by any
court flatterer?</p>

<p>However, Diane held out and played her part, caught scraps of
the conversation, and pieced them together, yet avoided all
appearance of inattention to M. de Selinville, and finally
dismissed him, and manoeuvred first Eustacie, and after a safe
interval Berenger, out of the cabinet.&nbsp; The latter bowed as he
bade her good night, and said, with the most open and cordial of
smiles, 'Cousin, I thank you with all my heart.'</p>

<p>The bright look seemed to her another shaft.&nbsp; 'What
happiness!' said she to herself.&nbsp; 'Can I overthrow it?&nbsp;
Bah! it will crumble of its own accord, even if I did
nothing!&nbsp; And my father and brother!'</p>

<p>Communication with her father and brother was not always easy to
Diane, for she lived among the Queen-mother's ladies.&nbsp; Her
brother was quartered in a sort of barrack among the gentlemen of
Monsieur's suite, and the old Chevalier was living in the room
Berenger had taken for him at the Croix de Lorraine, and it was
only on the most public days that they attended at the
palace.&nbsp; Such a day, however, there was on the ensuing Sunday,
when Henry of Navarre and Marguerite of France were to be
wedded.&nbsp; Their dispensation was come, but, to the great relief
of Eustacie, there was no answer with it to the application for the
CASSATION of her marriage.&nbsp; In fact, this dispensation had
never emanated from the Pope at all.&nbsp; Rome would not sanction
the union of a daughter of France with a Huguenot prince; and
Charles had forged the document, probably with his mother's
knowledge, in the hope of spreading her toils more completely round
her prey, while he trusted that the victims might prove too strong
for her, and destroy her web, and in breaking forth might release
himself.</p>

<p>Strange was the pageant of that wedding on Sunday, the
17<sup>th</sup> of August, 1572.&nbsp; The outward seeming was
magnificent, when all that was princely in France stood on the
splendidly decked platform in front of Notre-Dame, around the
bridegroom in the bright promise of his kingly endowments, and the
bride in her peerless beauty.&nbsp; Brave, noble-hearted, and
devoted were the gallant following of the one, splendid and highly
gifted the attendants of the other; and their union seemed to
promise peace to a long distracted kingdom.</p>

<p>Yet what an abyss lay beneath those trappings!&nbsp; The
bridegroom and his comrades were as lions in the toils of the
hunter, and the lure that had enticed them thither was the bride,
herself so unwilling a victim that her lips refused to utter the
espousal vows, and her head as force forward by her brother into a
sign of consent; while the favoured lover of her whole lifetime
agreed to the sacrifice in order to purchase the vengeance for
which he thirsted, and her mother, the corrupter of her own
children, looked complacently on at her ready-dug pit of treachery
and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Among the many who played unconscious on the surface of that
gulf of destruction, were the young creatures whose chief thought
in the pageant was the glance and smile from the gallery of the
Queen's ladies to the long procession of the English ambassador's
train, as they tried to remember their own marriage there; Berenger
with clear recollection of his father's grave, anxious face, and
Eustacie chiefly remembering her own white satin and turquoise
dress, which indeed she had seen on every great festival-day as the
best raiment of the image of Notre Dame de Bellaise.&nbsp; She
remained in the choir during mass, but Berenger accompanied the
rest of the Protestants with the bridegroom at their head into the
nave, where Coligny beguiled the time with walking about, looking
at the banners that had been taken from himself and Conde at
Montcontour and Jarnac, saying that he hoped soon to see them taken
down and replaced by Spanish banners.&nbsp; Berenger had followed
because he felt the need of doing as Walsingham and Sidney thought
right, but he had not been in London long enough to become hardened
to the desecration of churches by frequenting 'Paul's Walk.'&nbsp;
He remained bareheaded, and stood as near as he could to the choir,
listening to the notes that floated from the priests and acolytes
at the high altar, longing from the time when he and Eustacie
should be one in their prayers, and lost in a reverie, till a grave
old nobleman passing near him reproved him for dallying with the
worship of Rimmon.&nbsp; But his listening attitude had not passed
unobserved by others besides Huguenot observers.</p>

<p>The wedding was followed by a ball at the Louvre, from which,
however, all the stricter Huguenots absented themselves out of
respect to Sunday, and among them the family and guests of the
English Ambassador, who were in the meantime attending the divine
service that had been postponed on account of the morning's
ceremony.&nbsp; Neither was the Duke of Guise present at the
entertainment; for though he had some months previously been piqued
and entrapped into a marriage with Catherine of Cleves, yet his
passion for Marguerite was still so strong that he could not bear
to join in the festivities of her wedding with another.&nbsp; The
absence of so many distinguished persons caused the admission of
many less constantly privileged, and thus it was that Diane there
met both her father and brother, who eagerly drew her into a
window, and demanded what she had to tell them, laughing too at the
simplicity of the youth, who had left for the Chevalier a formal
announcement that he had dispatched his protest to Rome, and
considered himself as free to obtain his wife by any means in his
power.</p>

<p>'Where is <i>la petite</i>?' Narcisse demanded.&nbsp; Behind her
Queen, as usual?'</p>

<p>'The young Queen keeps her room to-night,' returned Diane.&nbsp;
'Nor do I advise you, brother, to thrust yourself in the way
of&nbsp; <i>la petite entetee</i> just at present.'</p>

<p>'What, is she so besotted with the peach face?&nbsp; He shall
pay for it!'</p>

<p>'Brother, no duel.&nbsp; Father, remind him that she would never
forgive him.'</p>

<p>'Fear not, daughter,' said the Chevalier; 'this folly can be
ended by much quieter modes, only you must first give us
information.'</p>

<p>'She tells me nothing,' said Diane; 'she is in one of her own
humours--high and mighty.'</p>

<p>'<i>Peste</i>! where is your vaunt of winding the little one
round your finger?'</p>

<p>'With time, I said,' replied Diane.&nbsp; Curiously enough, she
had no compunction in worming secrets from Eustacie and betraying
them, but she could not bear to think of the trap she had set for
the unsuspecting youth, and how ingenuously he had thanked her,
little knowing how she had listened to his inmost secrets.</p>

<p>'Time is everything,' said her father; 'delay will be our
ruin.&nbsp; Your inheritance will slip through your fingers, my
son.&nbsp; The youth will soon win favour by abjuring his heresy;
he will play the same game with the King as his father did with
King Henri.&nbsp; You will have nothing but your sword, and for
you, my poor girl, there is nothing but to throw yourself on the
kindness of your aunt at Bellaise, if she can receive the vows of a
dowerless maiden.'</p>

<p>'It will never be,' said Narcisse.&nbsp; 'My rapier will soon
dispose of a big rustic like that, who knows just enough of fencing
to make him an easy prey.&nbsp; What! I verily believe the great of
entreaty.&nbsp; 'And yet the fine fellow was willing enough to
break the marriage when he took her for the bride.'</p>

<p>'Nay, my son,' argued the Chevalier, will apparently to spare
his daughter from the sting of mortification, 'as I said, all can
be done without danger of bloodshed on either side, were we but
aware of any renewed project of elopement.&nbsp; The pretty pair
would be easily waylaid, the girl safely lodged at Bellaise, the
boy sent off to digest his pride in England.'</p>

<p>'Unhurt?' murmured Diane.</p>

<p>Her father checked Narcisse's mockery at her solicitude, as he
added, 'Unhurt? Yes.&nbsp; He is a liberal-hearted, gracious, fine
young man, whom I should much grieve to harm; but if you know of
any plan of elopement and conceal it, my daughter, then upon you
will lie either the ruin and disgrace of your family, or the death
of one or both of the youths.'</p>

<p>Diane saw that her question had betrayed her knowledge.&nbsp;
She spoke faintly.&nbsp; 'Something I did overhear, but I know not
how to utter a treason.'</p>

<p>'There is no treason where there is no trust, daughter,' said
the Chevalier, in the tone of a moral sage.&nbsp; 'Speak!'</p>

<p>Diane never disobeyed her father, and faltered, "Wednesday; it
is for Wednesday.&nbsp; They mean to leave the palace in the midst
of the masque; there is a market-boat from Leurre to meet them on
the river; his servants will be in it.'</p>

<p>'On Wednesday!'&nbsp; Father and son looked at each other.</p>

<p>'That shall be remedied,' said Narcisse.</p>

<p>'Child,' added her father, turning kindly to Diane, 'you have
saved our fortunes.&nbsp; There is put one thing more that you must
do.&nbsp; Make her obtain the pearls from him.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' sighed Diane, half shocked, half revengeful, as she
thought how he had withheld them from her.</p>

<p>'It is necessary,' said the Chevalier.&nbsp; 'The heirloom of
our house must not be risked.&nbsp; Secure the pearls, child, and
you will have done good service, and earned the marriage that shall
reward you.'</p>

<p>When he was gone, Diane pressed her hands together with a
strange sense of misery.&nbsp; He, who had shrunk from the memory
of little Diane's untruthfulness, what would he think of the
present Diane's treachery?&nbsp; Yet it was to save his life and
that of her brother-- and for the assertion of her victory over the
little robber, Eustacie.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.&nbsp; MONSIEUR'S BALLET.</h3>

<p>The Styx had fast bound her</p>

<p>Nine times around her.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
POPE, ODE ON ST. CECILIA'S DAY</p>

<p>Early on Monday morning came a message to Mademoiselle Nid de
Merle that she was to prepare to act the part of a nymph of
Paradise in the King's masque on Wednesday night, and must dress at
once to rehearse her part in the ballet specially designed by
Monsieur.</p>

<p>Her first impulse was to hurry to her own Queen, whom she
entreated to find some mode of exempting her.&nbsp; But Elisabeth,
who was still in bed, looked distressed and frightened, made signs
of caution, and when the weeping girl was on the point of telling
her of the project that would thus be ruined, silenced her by
saying, 'Hush!&nbsp; my poor child, I have but meddled too much
already.&nbsp; Our Lady grant that I have not done you more harm
than good!&nbsp; Tell me no more.'</p>

<p>'Ah!&nbsp; Madame, I will be discreet, I will tell you nothing;
but if you would only interfere to spare me from this ballet!&nbsp;
It is Monsieur's contrivance!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Madame, could you but
speak to the King!'</p>

<p>'Impossible, child,' said the Queen.&nbsp; 'Things are not her
as they were at happy Montpipeau.'</p>

<p>And the poor young Queen turned her face in to her pillow, and
wept.</p>

<p>Every one who was not in a dream of bliss like poor little
Eustacie knew that the King had been in so savage a mood ever since
his return that no one durst ask anything from him. &nbsp;a little
while since, he had laughed at his gentle wife for letting herself,
and Emperor's daughter, be trampled on where his brother Francis's
Queen, from her trumpery, beggarly realm, had held up her head, and
put down <i>la belle Mere</i>; he had amused himself with
Elisabeth's pretty little patronage of the young Ribaumonts as a
promising commencement in intriguing like other people; but now he
was absolutely violent at any endeavour to make him withstand his
mother, and had driven his wife back into that cold, listless,
indifferent shell of apathy from which affection and hope had begun
to rouse her.&nbsp; She knew it would only make it the worse for
her little Nid de Merle for her to interpose when Monsieur had made
the choice.</p>

<p>And Eustacie was more afraid of Monsieur than even of Narcisse,
and her Berenger could not be there to protect her.&nbsp; However,
there was protection in numbers.&nbsp; With twelve nymphs, and
cavaliers to match, even the Duke of Anjou could not accomplish the
being very insulting.&nbsp; Eustacie--light, agile, and
fairy-like--gained considerable credit for ready comprehension and
graceful evolutions.&nbsp; She had never been so much complimented
before, and was much cheered by praise.&nbsp; Diane showed herself
highly pleased with her little cousin's success, embraced her, and
told her she was finding her true level at court.&nbsp; She would
be the prettiest of all the nymphs, who were all small, since
fairies rather than Amazons were wanted in their position.&nbsp;
'And, Eustacie,' she added, 'you should wear the pearls.'</p>

<p>'The pearls!' said Eustacie.&nbsp; 'Ah! but HE always wears
them.&nbsp; I like to see them on his bonnet--they are hardly
whiter than his forehead.'</p>

<p>'Foolish little thing!' said Diane, 'I shall think little of his
love if he cares to see himself in them more than you.'</p>

<p>The shaft seemed carelessly shot, but Diane knew that it would
work, and so it did.&nbsp; Eustacie wanted to prove her husband's
love, not to herself, but to her cousin.</p>

<p>He made his way to her in the gardens of the Louvre that
evening, greatly dismayed at the report that had reached him that
she was to figure as a nymph of Elysium.&nbsp; She would thus be in
sight as a prominent figure the whole evening, even till an hour so
late that the market boat which Osbert had arranged for their
escape could not wait for them without exciting suspicion, and
besides, his delicate English feelings were revolted at the notion
of her forming a part of such a spectacle.&nbsp; She could not
understand his displeasure.&nbsp; If they could not go on
Wednesday, they could go on Saturday; and as to her acting, half
the noblest ladies in the court would be in piece, and if English
husbands did not like it, they must be the tyrants she had always
heard of.</p>

<p>'To be a gazing-stock---' began Berenger.</p>

<p>'Hush! Monsieur, I will hear no more, or I shall take care how I
put myself in your power.'</p>

<p>'That has been done for you, sweetheart,' he said, smiling with
perhaps a shade too much superiority; 'you are mine entirely
now.'</p>

<p>'that is not kind,' she pouted, almost crying--for between
flattery, excitement, and disappointment she was not like herself
that day, and she was too proud to like to be reminded that she was
in any one's power.</p>

<p>'I thought,' said Berenger, with the gentleness that always made
him manly in dealing with her, 'I thought you like to own yourself
mine.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, when you are good, and do not try to hector me for
what I cannot avoid.'</p>

<p>Berenger was candid enough to recollect that royal commands did
not brook disobedience, and, being thoroughly enamoured besides of
his little wife, he hastened to make his peace by saying, 'True,
<i>ma mie</i>, this cannot be helped.&nbsp; I was a wretch to find
fault.&nbsp; Think of it no more.'</p>

<p>'You forgive me?' she said, softened instantly.</p>

<p>'Forgive you?&nbsp; What for, pretty one?&nbsp; For my
forgetting that you are still a slave to a hateful Court?'</p>

<p>'Ah! then, if you forgive me, let me wear the pearls.'</p>

<p>'The poor pearls,' said Berenger, taken aback for a moment, 'the
meed of our forefather's valour, to form part of the pageant and
mummery?&nbsp; But never mind, sweetheart,' for he could not bear
to vex her again: 'you shall have them to-night: only take care of
them.&nbsp; My mother would look back on me if she knew I had let
them out of my care, but you and I are one after all.'</p>

<p>Berenger could not bear to leave his wife near the Duke of Anjou
and Narcisse, and he offered himself to the King as an actor in the
masque, much as he detested all he heard of its subject.&nbsp; The
King nodded comprehension, and told him it was open to him either
to be a demon in a tight suit of black cloth, with cloven-hoof
shoes, a long tail, and a trident; or one of the Huguenots who were
to be repulsed from Paradise for the edification of the
spectators.&nbsp; As these last were to wear suits of knightly
armour, Berenger much preferred making one of them in spite of
their doom.</p>

<p>The masque was given at the hall of the Hotel de Bourbon, where
a noble gallery accommodated the audience, and left full space
beneath for the actors.&nbsp; Down the centre of the stage flowed a
stream, broad enough to contain a boat, which was plied by the Abbe
de Mericour--transformed by a gray beard and hair and dismal mask
into Charon.</p>

<p>But so unused to navigation was he, so crazy and ill-trimmed his
craft, that his first performance would have been his submersion in
the Styx had not Berenger, better accustomed to boats than any of
the <i>dramatis personae</i>, caught him by the arms as he was
about to step in, pointed out the perils, weighted the frail
vessel, and given him a lesson in paddling it to and fro, with such
a masterly hand, that, had there been time for a change of dress,
the part of Charon would have been unanimously transferred to him;
but the delay could not be suffered, and poor Mericour, in fear of
a ducking, or worse, of ridicule, balanced himself, pole in hand,
in the midst of the river.&nbsp; To the right of the river was
Elysium--a circular island revolving on a wheel which was an
absolute orrery, representing in concentric circles the skies, with
the sun, moon, the seven planets, twelve signs, and the fixed
stars, all illuminated with small lamps.&nbsp; The island itself
was covered with verdure, in which, among bowers woven of gay
flowers, reposed twelve nymphs of Paradise, of whom Eustacie was
one.</p>

<p>On the other side of the stream was another wheel, whose grisly
emblems were reminders of Dante's infernal circles, and were
lighted by lurid flames, while little bells were hung round so as
to make a harsh jangling sound, and all of the court who had any
turn for buffoonery were leaping and dancing about as demons
beneath it, and uttering wild shouts.</p>

<p>King Charles and his two brothers stood on the margin of the
Elysian lake.&nbsp; King Henry, the Prince of Conde, and a
selection of the younger and gayer Huguenots, were the
assailants,--storming Paradise to gain possession of the
nymphs.&nbsp; It was a very illusive armour that they wore, thin
scales of gold or silver as cuirasses over their satin doublets,
and the swords and lances of festive combat in that court had been
of the bluntest foil ever since the father of these princes had
died beneath Montgomery's spear.&nbsp; And when the King and his
brothers, one of them a puny crooked boy, were the champions, the
battle must needs be the merest show, though there were lookers-on
who thought that, judging by appearances, the assailants ought to
have the best chance of victory, both literal and allegorical.</p>

<p>However, these three guardian angels had choice allies in the
shape of the infernal company, who, as fast as the Huguenots
crossed swords or shivered lances with their royal opponents,
encircled them with their long black arms, and dragged them
struggling away to Tartarus.&nbsp; Henry of Navarre yielded himself
with a good-will to the horse-play with which this was performed,
resisting just enough to give his demoniacal captors a good deal of
trouble, while yielding all the time, and taking them by surprise
by agile efforts, that showed that if he were excluded from
Paradise it was only by his own consent, and that he heartily
enjoyed the merriment.&nbsp; Most of his comrades, in especial the
young Count de Rochefoucauld, entered into the sport with the same
heartiness, but the Prince of Conde submitted to his fate with a
gloomy, disgusted countenance, that added much to the general
mirth; and Berenger, with Eustacie before his eyes, looking pale,
distressed, and ill at ease, was a great deal too much in
earnest.&nbsp; He had so veritable an impulse to leap forward and
snatch her from that giddy revolving prison, that he struck against
the sword of Monsieur with a hearty good-will.&nbsp; His silvered
lath snapped in his hand, and at that moment he was seized round
the waist, and, when his furious struggle was felt to be in
earnest, he was pulled over on his back, while yells and shouts of
discordant laughter rang round him, as demons pinioned him hand and
foot.</p>

<p>He thought he heard a faint cry from Eustacie, and, with a
sudden, unexpected struggle, started into a sitting posture; but a
derisive voice, that well he knew, cried, 'Ha, the deadly sin of
pride!&nbsp; Monsieur thinks his painted face pleases the
ladies.&nbsp; To the depths with him--' and therewith one imp
pulled him backwards again, while others danced a war-dance round
him, pointing their forks at him; and the prime tormentor, whom he
perfectly recognized, not only leapt over him, but spurned at his
face with a cloven foot, giving a blow, not of gay French malice,
but of malignity. It was too much for the boy's forbearance.&nbsp;
He struggled free, dashing his adversaries aside fiercely, and as
they again gathered about him, with the leader shouting, 'Rage,
too, rage!&nbsp; To the prey, imps--' he clenched his fist, and
dealt the foremost foe such a blow in the chest as to level him at
once with the ground.</p>

<p>'Monsieur forgets,' said a voice, friendly yet reproachful,
'that this is but sport.</p>

<p>It was Henry of Navarre himself who spoke, and bent to give a
hand to the fallen imp.&nbsp; A flush of shame rushed over
Berenger's face, already red with passion.&nbsp; He felt that he
had done wrong to use his strength at such a moment, and that,
though there had been spite in is assailant, he had not been
therefore justified.&nbsp; He was glad to see Narcisse rise lightly
to his feet, evidently unhurt, and, with the frankness with which
he had often made it up with Philip Thistlewood or his other
English comrades after a sharp tussle, he held out his hand,
saying, 'Good demon, your pardon.&nbsp; You roused my spirit, and I
forgot myself.'</p>

<p>'Demons forget not,' was the reply.&nbsp; 'At him, imps!'&nbsp;
And a whole circle of hobgoblins closed upon with their tridents,
forks, and other horrible implements, to drive him back within two
tall barred gates, which, illuminated by red flames, were to form
the ghastly prison of the vanquished.&nbsp; Perhaps fresh
indignities would have been attempted, had not the King of Navarre
thrown himself on his side, shared with him the brunt of all the
grotesque weapons, and battled them off with infinite spirit and
address, shielding him as it were from their rude insults by his
own dexterity and inviolability, though retreating all the time
till the infernal gates were closed on both.</p>

<p>Then Henry of Navarre, who never forgot a face, held out his
hand, saying, 'Tartarus is no region of good omen for friendships,
M. de Ribaumont, but, for lack of yonder devil's claw, here is
mine.&nbsp; I like to meet a comrade who can strike a hearty blow,
and ask a hearty pardon.'</p>

<p>'I was too hot, Sire,' confessed Berenger, with one of his
ingenuous blushes, 'but he enraged me.'</p>

<p>'He means mischief.' said Henry.&nbsp; 'Remember, if you are
molested respecting this matter, that you have here a witness that
you did the part of a gentleman.'</p>

<p>Berenger bowed his thanks, and began something about the honour,
but his eye anxiously followed the circuit on which Eustacie was
carried and the glance was quickly remarked.</p>

<p>'How?&nbsp; Your heart is spinning in that Mahometan paradise,
and that is what put such force into your fists.&nbsp; Which of the
houris is it?&nbsp; The little one with the wistful eyes, who
looked so deadly white, and shrieked out when the devilry
overturned you?&nbsp; Eh! Monsieur, you are a happy man.'</p>

<p>'I should be, Sire;' and Berenger was on the point of confiding
the situation of his affairs to this most engaging of princes, when
a fresh supply of prisoners, chased with wild antics and fiendish
yells by the devils, came headlong in on them; and immediately,
completing, as Henry said, the galimatias of mythology, a
pasteboard cloud was propelled on the stage, and disclosed the
deities Mercury and Cupid, who made a complimentary address to the
three princely brothers, inciting them to claim the nymphs whom
their valour had defended, and lead them through the mazes of a
choric celestial dance.</p>

<p>This dance had been the special device of Monsieur and the
ballet-master, and during the last three days the houris had been
almost danced off their legs with rehearsing it morning, noon, and
night, but one at least of them was scarcely in a condition for its
performance.&nbsp; Eustacie, dizzied at the first minute by the
whirl of her Elysian merry-go-round, had immediately after become
conscious of that which she had been too childish to estimate
merely in prospect, the exposure to universal gaze.&nbsp; Strange
staring eyes, glaring lights, frightful imps seemed to wheel round
her in an intolerable delirious succession.&nbsp; Her only refuge
was in closing her eyes, but even this could not long be persevered
in, so necessary a part of the pageant was she; and besides, she
had Berenger to look for, Berenger, whom she had foolishly laughed
at for knowing how dreadful it would be.&nbsp; But of course the
endeavour to seek for one object with her eyes made the dizziness
even more dreadful; and when, at length, she beheld him dragged
down by the demoniacal creatures, whose horrors were magnified by
her confused senses, and the next moment she was twirled out of
sight, her cry of distracted alarm was irrepressible.&nbsp; Carried
round again and again, on a wheel that to her was far more like
Ixion's than that of the spheres, she never cleared her perceptions
as to where he was, and only was half-maddened by the fantastic
whirl of incongruous imagery, while she barely sat out Mercury's
lengthy harangue; and when her wheel stood still, and she was
released, she could not stand, and was indebted to Charon and one
of her fellow-nymphs for supporting her to a chair in the back of
the scene.&nbsp; Kind Charon hurried to bring her wine, the lady
revived her with essences, and the ballet-master clamoured for his
performers.</p>

<p>Ill or well, royal ballets must be danced.&nbsp; One long sob,
one gaze round at the refreshing sight of a room no longer in
motion, one wistful look at the gates of Tartarus, and the misery
of the throbbing, aching head must be disregarded.&nbsp; The
ballet-master touched the white cheeks with rouge, and she stepped
forward just in time, for Monsieur himself was coming angrily
forward to learn the cause of the delay.</p>

<p>Spectators said the windings of that dance were exquisitely
graceful.&nbsp; It was well that Eustacie's drilling had been so
complete, for she moved through it blindly, senselessly, and when
it was over was led back between the two Demoiselles de Limeuil to
the apartment that served as a green-room, drooping and almost
fainting.&nbsp; They seated her in a chair, and consulted round
her, and her cousin Narcisse was among the first to approach; but
no sooner had she caught sight of his devilish trim than with a
little shriek she shut her eyes, and flung herself to the other
side of the chair.</p>

<p>'My fair cousin,' he said, opening his black vizard, 'do you not
see me?&nbsp; I am no demon, remember!&nbsp; I am your cousin.'</p>

<p>'That makes it no better,' said Eustacie, too much disordered
and confused to be on her guard, and hiding her face with her
hands.&nbsp; 'Go, go, I entreat.'</p>

<p>In fact he had already done this, and the ladies added their
counsel; for indeed the poor child could scarcely hold up her head,
but she said, 'I should like to stay, if I could: a little, a
little longer.&nbsp; Will they not open those dreadful bars?' she
added, presently.</p>

<p>'They are even now opening them,' said Mdlle. de Limeuil.&nbsp;
'Hark!&nbsp; they are going to fight <i>en melle</i>.&nbsp; Mdlle.
de Nid de Merle is better now?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes; let not detain you.'</p>

<p>Eustacie would have risen, but the two sisters had fluttered
back, impatient to lose nothing of the sports; and her cousin in
his grim disguise stood full before her.&nbsp; 'No haste, cousin,'
he said; 'you are not fit to move.'</p>

<p>'Oh, then go,' said Eustacie, suffering too much not to be
petulant.&nbsp; 'You make me worse.'</p>

<p>'And why? It was not always thus,' began Narcisse, so eager to
seize an opportunity as to have little consideration for her
condition; but she was unable to bear any more, and broke
out:&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Yes, it was; I always detested you more than ever, since you
deceived me so cruelly.&nbsp; Oh, do but leave me!'</p>

<p>'You scorn me, then!&nbsp; You prefer to me--who have loved you
so long--that childish new-comer, who was ready enough to cast you
off.'</p>

<p>'Prefer!&nbsp; He is my husband!&nbsp; It is an insult for any
one else to speak to me thus!' said Eustacie, drawing herself up,
and rising to her feet; but she was forced to hold by the back of
her chair, and Diane and her father appearing at that moment, she
tottered towards the former, and becoming quite passive under the
influence of violent dizziness and headache, made no objection to
being half led, half carried, through galleries that connected the
Hotel de Bourbon with the Louvre.</p>

<p>And thus it was that when Berenger had fought out his part in
the <i>melle</i> of the prisoners released, and had maintained the
honours of the rose-coloured token in his helmet, he found that his
lady-love had been obliged by indisposition to return home; and
while he stood, folding his arms to restrain their strong
inclination to take Narcisse by the throat and demand whether this
were another of his deceptions, a train of fireworks suddenly
exploded in the middle of the Styx--a last surprise, especially
contrived by King Charles, and so effectual that half the ladies
were shrieking, and imagining that they and the whole hall had
blown up together.</p>

<p>A long supper, full of revelry, succeeded, and at length Sidney
ad Ribaumont walked home together in the midst of their armed
servants bearing torches.&nbsp; All the way home Berenger was
bitter in vituperation of the hateful pageant and all its
details.</p>

<p>'Yea, truly,' replied Sidney; 'methought that it betokens
disease in the mind of a nation when their festive revelry is thus
ghastly, rendering the most awful secrets made known by our God in
order to warm man from sin into a mere antic laughing-stock.&nbsp;
Laughter should be moved by what is fair and laughter-worthy--even
like such sports as our own "Midsummer Night's Dream."&nbsp; I have
read that the bloody temper of Rome fed itself in gladiator shows,
and verily, what we beheld to-night betokens something at once
grisly and light-minded in the mood of this country.'</p>

<p>Sidney thought so the more when on the second ensuing morning
the Admiral de Coligny was shot through both hands by an assassin
generally known to have been posted by the Duke of Guise, yet often
called by the sinister sobriquet of <i>Le Tueur de Roi</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.&nbsp; THE KING'S TRAGEDY.</h3>

<p>The night is come, no fears disturb</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleep of innocence</p>

<p>They trust in kingly faith, and kingly oath.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sleep, alas! they sleep</p>

<p>Go to the palace, wouldst thou know</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How hideous night can be;</p>

<p>Eye is not closed in those accursed walls,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor heart is quiet there!</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
--Southey, BARTHOLOMEW'S EVE</p>

<p>'Young gentlemen,' said Sir Francis Walsingham, as he rose from
dinner on the Saturday, 'are you bound for the palace this
evening?'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>'I am, so please your Excellency,' returned Berenger.</p>

<p>'I would have you both to understand that you must have a care
of yourselves,' said the Ambassador.&nbsp; 'The Admiral's wound has
justly caused much alarm, and I hear that the Protestants are going
vapouring about in so noisy and incautious a manner, crying out for
justice, that it is but too likely that the party of the
Queen-mother and the Guise will be moved to strong measures.'</p>

<p>'They will never dare lay a finger upon us!' said Sidney.</p>

<p>'In a terror-stricken fray men are no respecters of persons,'
replied Sir Francis.&nbsp; 'This house is, of course, inviolable;
and, whatever the madness of the people, we have stout hearts
enough here to enforce respect thereto; but I cannot answer even
for an Englishman's life beyond its precincts; and you, Ribaumont,
whom I cannot even claim as my Queen's subject--I greatly fear to
trust you beyond its bounds.'</p>

<p>'I cannot help it, sir.&nbsp; Nay, with the most grateful thanks
for all your goodness to me, I must pray you not to take either
alarm or offence if I return not this night.'</p>

<p>'No more, my friend,' said Walsingham, quickly; 'let me know
nothing of your purposes, but take care of yourself.&nbsp; I would
you were safe at home again, though the desire may seem
inhospitable.&nbsp; The sooner the better with whatever you have to
do.'</p>

<p>'Is the danger so imminent?' asked Sidney.</p>

<p>'I know nothing, Philip.&nbsp; All I can tell is that, as I have
read that dogs and cattle scent an earthquake in the air, so man
and women seem to breathe a sense of danger in this city.&nbsp; And
to me the graciousness with which the Huguenots have been of late
treated wears a strangely suspicious air.&nbsp; Sudden and secret
is the blow like to be, and we cannot be too much on our
guard.&nbsp; Therefore remember, my young friends both, that your
danger or death would fall heavily on those ye love and honour at
home.'</p>

<p>So saying, he left the two youths, unwilling to seek further
confidence, and Berenger held his last consultation with Sidney, to
whom he gave directions for making full explanation to Walsingham
in his absence, and expediting Mr. Adderley's return to
England.&nbsp; Osbert alone was to go to the Louvre with him, after
having seen the five English grooms on board the little decked
market-vessel on the Seine, which was to await the fugitives.&nbsp;
Berenger was to present himself in the palace as in his ordinary
court attendance, and, contriving to elude notice among the throng
who were there lodged, was to take up his station at the foot of
the stairs leading to the apartments of ladies, whence Eustacie was
to descend at about eleven o'clock, with her maid Veronique.&nbsp;
Landry Osbert was to join them from the lackey's hall below, where
he had a friend, and the connivance of the porter at the postern
opening towards the Seine had been secured.</p>

<p>Sidney wished much to accompany him to the palace, if his
presence could be any aid or protection, but on consideration it
was decided that his being at the Louvre was likely to attract
notice to Ribaumont's delaying there.&nbsp; The two young men
therefore shook hands and parted, as youths who trusted that they
had begun a lifelong friendship, with mutual promises to write to
one another-- the one, the adventures of his flight; the other, the
astonishment it would excite.&nbsp; And auguries were exchanged of
merry meetings in London, and of the admiration the lovely little
wife would excite at Queen Elizabeth's court.</p>

<p>Then, with an embrace such as English friends then gave, they
separated at the gate; and Sidney stood watching, as Berenger
walked free and bold down the street, his sword at his side, his
cloak over one shoulder, his feathered cap on one side, showing his
bright curling hair, a sunshiny picture of a victorious
bridegroom--such a picture as sent Philip Sidney's wits back to
Arcadia.</p>

<p>It was not a day of special state, but the palace was greatly
crowded.&nbsp; The Huguenots were in an excited mood, inclined to
rally round Henry of Navarre, whose royal title made him be looked
on as is a manner their monarch, though his kingdom had been
swallowed by Spain, and he was no more than a French duke distantly
related to royalty in the male line, and more nearly through his
grandmother and bride.&nbsp; The eight hundred gentlemen he had
brought with him swarmed about his apartments, making their lodging
on staircases and in passages; and to Berenger it seemed as if the
King's guards and Monsieur's gentlemen must have come in in equal
numbers to balance them.&nbsp; Narcisse was there, and Berenger
kept cautiously amid his Huguenot acquaintance, resolved not to
have a quarrel thrust on him which he could not honourably
desert.&nbsp; It was late before he could work his way to the young
Queen's reception-room, where he found Eustacie.&nbsp; She looked
almost as white as at the masque; but there was a graver, less
childish expression in her face than he had ever seen before, and
her eyes glanced confidence when they met his.</p>

<p>Behind the Queen's chair a few words could be spoken.</p>

<p><i>'Ma mie,</i> art thou well again?&nbsp; Canst bear this
journey now?'</p>

<p>'Quite well, now! quite ready.&nbsp; Oh that we may never have
masques in England!'</p>

<p>He smiled--'Never such as this!'</p>

<p>'Ah! thou knowest best.&nbsp; I am glad I am thine already; I am
so silly, thou wouldest never have chosen me!&nbsp; But thou wilt
teach me, and I will strive to be very good!&nbsp; And oh! let me
but give one farewell to Diane.'</p>

<p>'It is too hard to deny thee aught to-night, sweetheart, but
judge for thyself.&nbsp; Think of the perils, and decide.'</p>

<p>Before Eustacie could answer, a rough voice came near, the King
making noisy sport with the Count de Rochefoucauld and
others.&nbsp; He was louder and ruder than Berenger had ever yet
seen him, almost giving the notion of intoxication; but neither he
nor his brother Henry ever tasted wine, though both had a strange
pleasure in being present at the orgies of their companions: the
King, it was generally said, from love of the self-forgetfulness of
excitement-- the Duke of Anjou, because his cool brain there
collected men's secrets to serve afterwards for his spiteful
diversion.</p>

<p>Berenger would willingly have escaped notice, but his bright
face and sunny hair always made him conspicuous, and the King
suddenly strode up to him: 'You here, sir?&nbsp; I thought you
would have managed your affairs so as to be gone long ago!' then
before Berenger could reply, 'However, since here you are, come
along with me to my bedchamber!&nbsp; We are to have a carouse
there to-night that will ring through all Paris!&nbsp; Yes, and
shake Rochefoucauld out of his bed at midnight!&nbsp; You will be
one of us, Ribaumont?&nbsp; I command it!'</p>

<p>And without waiting for reply he turned away with an arm round
Rochefoucauld's neck, and boisterously addressed another of the
company, almost as wildly as if he were in the mood that Scots call
'fey.'</p>

<p>'Royalty seems determined to frustrate our plans,' said
Berenger, as soon as the King was out of hearing.</p>

<p>'But you will not go!&nbsp; His comrades drink till--oh! two,
three in the morning.&nbsp; We should never get away.'</p>

<p>'No, I must risk his displeasure.&nbsp; We shall soon be beyond
his reach.&nbsp; But at least I may make his invitation a reason
for remaining in the Louvre.&nbsp; People are departing!&nbsp; Soon
wilt thou be my own.'</p>

<p>'As soon as the Queen's <i>coucher</i> is over!&nbsp; I have but
to change to a traveling dress.'</p>

<p>'At the foot of the winding stair.&nbsp; Sweetest be brave!'</p>

<p>'I fear nothing with thee to guard me.&nbsp; See, the Queen is
rising.'</p>

<p>Elizabeth was in effect rising to make her respectful progress
to the rooms of the Queen-mother, to bid her good night; and
Eustacie must follow.&nbsp; Would Diane be there?&nbsp; Oh that the
command to judge between her heart and her caution had not been
given!&nbsp; Cruel kindness!</p>

<p>Diane was there, straight as a poplar, cold as marble, with
fixed eyes.&nbsp; Eustacie stole up to her, and touched her.&nbsp;
She turned with a start.&nbsp; 'Cousin, you have been very good to
me!'&nbsp; Diane started again, as if stung.&nbsp; You will love me
still, whatever you hear?'</p>

<p>'Is this meant for farewell?'&nbsp; said Diane, grasping her
wrist.</p>

<p>'Do not ask me, Diane.&nbsp; I may not.'</p>

<p>'Where there is no trust there is no treason,' said Diane,
dreamily.&nbsp; 'No, answer me not, little one, there will be time
for that another day.&nbsp; Where is he?'</p>

<p>'In the <i>oeil-de-boeuf</i>, between the King's and Queen's
suites of rooms.&nbsp; I must go.&nbsp; There is the Queen
going.&nbsp; Diane, one loving word.'</p>

<p>'Silly child, you shall have plenty another time,' said Diane,
breaking away.&nbsp; 'Follow thy Queen now!'</p>

<p>Catherine, who sat between her daughters Claude and Marguerite,
looked pre-occupied, and summarily dismissed her daughter-in-law,
Elizabeth, whom Eustacie was obliged to follow to her own
state-room.&nbsp; There all the forms of the <i>coucher</i> were
tediously gone through; every pin had its own ceremony, and even
when her Majesty was safely deposited under her blue satin coverlet
the ladies still stood round till she felt disposed to fall
asleep.&nbsp; Elisabeth was both a sleepy and a considerate person,
so that this was not so protracted a vigil as was sometimes exacted
by the more wakeful princesses; but Eustacie could not escape from
it till it was already almost midnight, the period for her
tryst.</p>

<p>Her heart was very full.&nbsp; It was not the usual flutter and
terror of an eloping girl.&nbsp; Eustacie was a fearless little
being, and her conscience had no alarms; her affections were wholly
with Berenger, and her transient glimpses of him had been as of
something come out of a region higher, tenderer, stronger, purer,
more trustworthy than that where she had dwelt.&nbsp; She was proud
of belonging to him.&nbsp; She had felt upheld by the consciousness
through years of waiting, and now he more than realized her hopes,
and she could have wept for exulting joy.&nbsp; Yet it was a
strange, stealthy break with all she had to leave behind.&nbsp; The
light to which he belonged seemed strange, chill, dazzling light,
and she shivered at the thought of it, as if the new world, new
ideas, and new requirements could only be endured with him to
shield her and help her on.&nbsp; And withal, there seemed to her a
shudder over the whole place on that night.&nbsp; The King's eyes
looked wild and startled, the Queen-mother's calm was strained, the
Duchess of Lorraine was evidently in a state of strong nervous
excitement; there were strange sounds, strange people moving about,
a weight on everything, as if they were under the shadow of a
thunder-cloud.&nbsp; 'Could it be only her own fancy?' she said to
herself, because this was to be the great event of her life, for
surely all these great people could not know or heed that little
Eustacie de Ribaumont was to make her escape that night!</p>

<p>The trains of royalty were not sumptuously lodged.&nbsp; France
never has cared so much for comfort as for display.&nbsp; The
waiting-lady of the bedchamber slept in the ante-room of her
mistress; the others, however high their rank, were closely herded
together up a winding stair leading to a small passage, with tiny,
cell-like recesses, wherein the demoiselles slept, often with their
maids, and then dressed themselves in the space afforded by the
passage.&nbsp; Eustacie's cell was nearly at the end of the
gallery, and exchanging 'good-nights' with her companions, she
proceeded to her recess, where she expected to find Veronique ready
to adjust her dress.&nbsp; Veronique, however, was missing; but
anxious to lose no time, she had taken off her delicate white satin
farthingale to change it for an unobtrusive dark woollen kirtle,
when, to her surprise and dismay, a loud creaking, growling sound
made itself heard outside the door at the other end.&nbsp;
Half-a-dozen heads came out of their cells; half-a-dozen voices
asked and answered the question, 'What is it?'&nbsp; 'They are
bolting our door outside.'&nbsp; But only Eustacie sped like
lightning along the passage, pulled at the door, and cried,
'Open!&nbsp; Open, I say!'&nbsp; No answer, but the other bolt
creaked.</p>

<p>'You mistake, CONCIERGE!&nbsp; We are never bolted in!&nbsp; My
maid is shut out.'</p>

<p>No answer, but the step retreated.&nbsp; Eustacie clasped her
hands with a cry that she could hardly have repressed, but which
she regretted the next moment.</p>

<p>Gabrielle de Limeuil laughed.&nbsp; 'What, Mademoiselle, are you
afraid they will not let us out to-morrow?'</p>

<p>'My maid!' murmured Eustacie, recollecting that she must give a
colour to her distress.</p>

<p>'Ah! perhaps she will summon old Pierre to open for us.'</p>

<p>This suggestion somewhat consoled Eustacie, and she stood
intently listening for Veronique's step, wishing that her
companions would hold their peace; but the adventure amused them,
and they discussed whether it were a blunder of the CONCIERGE, or a
piece of prudery of Madame la Comtesse, or, after all, a
precaution.&nbsp; The palace so full of strange people, who could
say what might happen?&nbsp; And there was a talk of a conspiracy
of the Huguenots.&nbsp; At any rate, every one was too much
frightened to go to sleep, and, some sitting on the floor, some on
a chest, some on a bed, the girls huddled together in Gabrielle de
Limeuil's recess, the nearest to the door, and one after another
related horrible tales of blood, murder, and vengeance--then, alas!
Only too frequent occurrences in their unhappy land--each bringing
some frightful contribution from her own province, each enhancing
upon the last-told story, and ever and anon pausing with bated
breath at some fancied sound, or supposed start of one of the
others; then clinging close together, and renewing the ghastly
anecdote, at first in a hushed voice that grew louder with the
interest of the story.&nbsp; Eustacie alone would not join the
cluster.&nbsp; Her cloak round her shoulders, she stood with her
back against the door, ready to profit by the slightest indication
outside of a step that might lead to her release, or at least
enable her to communicate with Veronique; longing ardently that her
companions would go to bed, yet unable to avoid listening with the
like dreadful fascination to each of the terrible histories, which
added each moment to the nervous horror of the whole party.&nbsp;
Only one, a dull and composed girl, felt the influence of
weariness, and dozed with her head in her companion's lap; but she
was awakened by one general shudder and suppressed cry when the
hoarse clang of a bell struck on the ears of the already terrified,
excited maidens.</p>

<p>'The tocsin!&nbsp; The bell of St. Germain!&nbsp; Fire!&nbsp;
No, a Huguenot rising!&nbsp; Fire!&nbsp; Oh, let us out!&nbsp; Let
us out!&nbsp; The window!&nbsp; Where is the fire?&nbsp;
Nowhere!&nbsp; See the lights!&nbsp; Hark, that was a shot!&nbsp;
It was in the palace!&nbsp; A heretic rising!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; there
was to be a slaughter of the heretics!&nbsp; I heard it
whispered.&nbsp; Oh, let us out!&nbsp; Open the door!'</p>

<p>But nobody heard:&nbsp; nobody opened.&nbsp; There was one who
stood without word or cry, close to the door--her eyes dilated, her
cheek colourless, her whole person, soul and body alike,
concentrated in that one impulse to spring forward the first moment
the bolt should be drawn.&nbsp; But still the door remained fast
shut!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.&nbsp; THE PALACE OF SLAUGHTER</h3>

<p>A human shambles with blood-reeking floor.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MISS SWANWICK, Esch. Agamemnon</p>

<p>The door was opened at last, but not till full daylight.
&nbsp;It found Eustacie as ready to rush forth, past all
resistance, as she had been the night before, and she was already
in the doorway when her maid Veronique, her face swollen with
weeping, caught her by the hands and implored her to turn back and
listen.</p>

<p>And words about a rising of the Huguenots, a general
destruction, corpses lying in the court, were already passing
between the other maidens and the concierge.&nbsp; Eustacie turned
upon her servant:</p>

<p>'Veronique, what means it?&nbsp; Where is he?'</p>

<p>'Alas!&nbsp; alas!&nbsp; Ah! &nbsp;Mademoiselle, do but lie
down!&nbsp; Woe is me!&nbsp; I saw it all!&nbsp; Lie down, and I
will tell you.'</p>

<p>'Tell!&nbsp; I will not move till you have told me where my
husband is,' said Eustacie, gazing with eyes that seemed to
Veronique turned to stone.</p>

<p>'Ah!&nbsp; my lady--my dear lady!&nbsp; I was on the turn of the
stairs, and saw all.&nbsp; The traitor--the Chevalier
Narcisse--came on him, cloaked like you--and--shot him dead--with,
oh, such cruel words of mockery!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; woe the day!&nbsp;
Stay, stay, dear lady, the place is all blood--they are slaying
them all--all the Huguenots!&nbsp; Will no one stop
her?--Mademoiselle--ma'm'selle!--'</p>

<p>For Eustacie no sooner gathered the sense of Veronique's words
than she darted suddenly forwards, and was in a few seconds more at
the foot of the stairs.&nbsp; There, indeed, lay a pool of dark
gore, and almost in it Berenger's black velvet cap, with the heron
plume.&nbsp; Eustacie, with a low cry, snatched it up, continued
her headlong course along the corridor, swiftly as a bird,
Veronique following, and vainly shrieking to her to stop.&nbsp;
Diane, appearing at the other end of the gallery, saw but for a
moment the little figure, with the cloak gathered round her neck,
and floating behind her, understood Veronique's cry and joined in
the chase across hall and gallery, where more stains were to be
seen, even down to the marble stairs, every step slippery with
blood.&nbsp; Others there were who saw and stood aghast, not
understanding the apparition that flitted on so swiftly, never
pausing till at the great door at the foot of the stairs she
encountered a gigantic Scottish archer, armed to the teeth.&nbsp;
She touched his arm, and standing with folder arms, looked up and
said, 'Good soldier, kill me!&nbsp; I am a Huguenots!'</p>

<p>'Stop her! bring her back!' cried Diane from behind.&nbsp; 'It
is Mdlle. De Nil-de-Merle!'</p>

<p>'No, no!&nbsp; My husband is Huguenot!&nbsp; I am a
Huguenot!&nbsp; Let them kill me, I say!'--struggling with Diane,
who had now come up with her, and was trying to draw her back.</p>

<p>'Puir lassie!' muttered the stout Scotsman to himself, 'this
fearsome night has driven her demented.'</p>

<p>But, like a true sentinel, he moved neither hand nor foot to
interfere, as shaking herself loose from Diane, she was springing
down the steps into the court, when at that moment the young Abbe
de Mericour was seen advancing, pale, breathless, horrorstruck, and
to him Diane shrieked to arrest the headlong course.&nbsp; He
obeyed, seeing the wild distraction of the white face and widely
glaring eyes, took her by both hands, and held her in a firm grasp,
saying, 'Alas, lady, you cannot go out.&nbsp; It is no sight for
any one.'</p>

<p>'They are killing the Protestants,' she said; 'I am one!&nbsp;
Let me find them and die.'</p>

<p>A strong effort to free herself ensued, but it was so suddenly
succeeded by a swoon that the Abbe could scarcely save her from
dropping on the steps.&nbsp; Diane begged him to carry her in,
since they were in full view of men-at-arms in the court, and,
frightful to say, of some of the ladies of the palace, who, in the
frenzy of that dreadful time, had actually come down to examine the
half-stripped corpses of the men with whom they had jested not
twelve hours before.</p>

<p>'Ah! it is no wonder,' said the youthful Abbe, as he tenderly
lifted the inanimate figure.&nbsp; 'This has been a night of
horrors.&nbsp; I was coming in haste to know whether the King knows
of this frightful plot of M. de Guise, and the bloody work that is
passing in Paris.'</p>

<p>'The King!' exclaimed Diane.&nbsp; 'M. l'Abbe, do you know where
he is now?&nbsp; In the balcony overlooking the river, taking aim
at the fugitives!&nbsp; Take care!&nbsp; Even your <i>soutane</i>
would not save you if M. d'O and his crew heard you.&nbsp; But I
must pray you to aid me with this poor child!&nbsp; I dread that
her wild cries should be heard.'</p>

<p>The Abbe, struck dumb with horror, silently obeyed Mdlle. De
Ribaumont, and brought the still insensible Eustacie to the
chamber, now deserted by all the young ladies.&nbsp; He laid her on
her bed, and finding he could do no more, left her to her cousin
and her maid.</p>

<p>The poor child had been unwell and feverish ever since the
masque, and the suspense of these few days with the tension of that
horrible night had prostrated her.&nbsp; She only awoke from her
swoon to turn her head from the light and refuse to be spoken
to.</p>

<p>'But, Eustacie, child, listen; this is all in vain--he lives,'
said Diane.</p>

<p>'Weary me not with falsehoods,' faintly said Eustacie.</p>

<p>'No! no! no!&nbsp; They meant to hinder your flight, but---'</p>

<p>'They knew of it?' cried Eustacie, sitting up suddenly.&nbsp;
'Then you told them.&nbsp; Go--go; let me never see you more!&nbsp;
You have been his death!'</p>

<p>'Listen!&nbsp; I am sure he lives!&nbsp; What! would they injure
one whom my father loved?&nbsp; I heard my father say he would not
have him hurt.&nbsp; Depend upon it, he is safe on his way to
England.'</p>

<p>Eustacie gave a short but frightful hysterical laugh, and
pointed to Veronique.&nbsp; 'She saw it,' she said; 'ask her.'</p>

<p>'Saw what?' said Diane, turning fiercely on Veronique.&nbsp;
'What vile deceit have you half killed your lady with?'</p>

<p>'Alas!&nbsp; Mademoiselle, I did but tell her what I had seen,'
sighed Veronique, trembling.</p>

<p>'Tell me!' said Diane, passionately.</p>

<p>'Yes, everything,' said Eustacie, sitting up.</p>

<p>'Ah!&nbsp; Mademoiselle, it will make you ill again.'</p>

<p>'I WILL be ill--I WILL die!&nbsp; Heaven's slaying is better
than man's.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tell her how you saw Narcisse.'</p>

<p>'False girl!' burst out Diane.</p>

<p>'No, no,' cried Veronique.&nbsp; 'Oh, pardon me, Mademoiselle, I
could not help it.'</p>

<p>In spite of her reluctance, she was forced to tell that she had
found herself locked out of her mistress's room, and after losing
much time in searching for the concierge, learnt that the ladies
were locked up by order of the Queen-mother, and was strongly
advised not to be running about the passages.&nbsp; After a time,
however, while sitting with the concierge's wife, she heard such
frightful whispers from men with white badges, who were admitted
one by one by the porter, and all led silently to a small lower
room, that she resolved on seeking out the Baron's servant, and
sending him to warn his master, while she would take up her station
at her lady's door.&nbsp; She found Osbert, and with him was
ascending a narrow spiral leading from the offices--she,
unfortunately, the foremost.&nbsp; As she came to the top, a
scuffle was going on--four men had thrown themselves upon one, and
a torch distinctly showed her the younger Chevalier holding a
pistol to the cheek of the fallen man, and she heard the worlds,
<i>'Le baiser d'Eustacie!</i>&nbsp; <i>Jet e barbouillerai ce chien
de visage,'</i> and at the same moment the pistol was
discharged.&nbsp; She sprang back, oversetting, as she believed,
Osbert, and fled shrieking to the room of the concierge, who shut
her in till morning.</p>

<p>'And how--how,' stammered Diane, 'should you know it was the
Baron?'</p>

<p>Eustacie, with a death-like look, showed for a moment what even
in her swoon she had held clenched to her bosom, the velvet cap
soaked with blood.</p>

<p>'Besides,' added Veronique, resolved to defend her assertion,
'whom else would the words suit?&nbsp; Besides, are not all the
heretic gentlemen dead?&nbsp; Why, as I sat there in the porter's
room, I heard M. d'O call each one of them by name, one after the
other, into the court, and there the white-sleeves cut them down or
pistolled them like sheep for the slaughter.&nbsp; They lie all out
there on the terrace like so many carcases at market ready for
winter salting.'</p>

<p>'All slain?' said Eustacie, dreamily.</p>

<p>'All, except those that the King called into his own <i>garde
robe</i>.'</p>

<p>'Then, I slew him!' Eustacie sank back.</p>

<p>'I tell you, child,' said Diane, almost angrily, 'he
lives.&nbsp; Not a hair of his head was to be hurt!&nbsp; The girl
deceives you.'</p>

<p>But Eustacie had again become insensible, and awoke delirious,
entreating to have the door opened, and fancying herself still on
the revolving elysium, 'Oh, demons, have pity!' was her cry.</p>

<p>Diane's soothings were like speaking to the winds; and at last
she saw the necessity of calling in further aid; but afraid of the
scandal that the poor girl's raving accusations might create, she
would not send for the Huguenots surgeon, Ambroise Pare, whom the
King had carefully secured in his own apartments, but employed one
of the barber valets of the Queen-mother's household.&nbsp; Poor
Eustacie was well pleased to see her blood flowing, and sank back
on her pillow murmuring that she had confessed her husband's faith,
and would soon be one with him, and Diane feared for a moment lest
the swoon should indeed be death.</p>

<p>The bleeding was so far effectual that it diminished the fever,
and Eustacie became rational again when she had dozed and wakened,
but she was little able or willing to speak, and would not so much
as listen to Diane's asseverations that Veronique had made a
frightful error, and that the Baron would prove to be alive.&nbsp;
Whether it were that the admission that Diane had known of the
project for preventing the elopement that invalidated her words, or
whether the sufferer's instinct made her believe Veronique's
testimony rather than her cousin's assurances, it was all 'cramming
words into her ear against the stomach of her sense,' and she
turned away from them with a piteous, petulant hopelessness: 'Could
they not even let her alone to die in peace!'</p>

<p>Diane was almost angered at this little silly child being in
such an agony of sorrow--she, who could never have known how to
love him.&nbsp; And after all this persistent grief was wilfully
thrown away.&nbsp; For Diane spoke in perfect sincerity when she
taxed Veronique with an injurious, barbarous mistake.&nbsp; She
knew her father's strong aversion to violence, and the real
predilection that Berenger's good mien, respectful manners, and
liberal usage had won from him, and she believed he had much rather
the youth lived, provided he were inoffensive.&nbsp; No doubt a
little force had been necessary to kidnap one so tall, active, and
determined, and Veronique had made up her horrible tale after the
usual custom of waiting-maids.</p>

<p>Nothing else SHOULD be true.&nbsp; Did she think otherwise, she
should be even more frantic than Eustacie!&nbsp; Why, it would be
her own doing!&nbsp; She had betrayed the day of the escape--she
had held aloof from warning.&nbsp; There was pleasure in securing
Nid-de-Merle for her brother, pleasure in balking the foolish child
who had won the heart that disregarded her.&nbsp; Nay, there might
have been even pleasure in the destruction of the scorner of her
charms--the foe of her house--there might have been pride in
receiving Queen Catherine's dexterous hint that she had been an apt
pupil, if the young Baron had only been something
different--something less fair, gracious, bright, and pure.&nbsp;
One bright angel seemed to have flitted across her path, and
nothing should induce her to believe she had destroyed him.</p>

<p>The stripped corpses of the murdered Huguenots of the palace had
been laid in a line on the terrace, and the ladies who had laughed
with them the night before went to inspect them in death.&nbsp; A
few remnants of Soeur Monique's influence would have withheld
Diane, but that a frenzy of suspense was growing on her.&nbsp; She
must see for herself.&nbsp; If it were so, she must secure a
fragment of the shining flaxen hair, if only as a token that
anything so pure and bright had walked the earth.</p>

<p>She went on the horrible quest, shrinking where others
stared.&nbsp; For it was a pitiless time, and the squadron of the
Queen-mother were as lost to womanhood as the fishwomen of two
centuries later.&nbsp; But Diane saw no corpse at once so tall, so
young, and so fair, though blond Normans and blue-blooded Franks,
lads scarce sixteen and stalwart warriors, lay in one melancholy
rank.&nbsp; She at least bore away the certainly that the English
Ribaumont was not there; and if not, he MUST be safe!&nbsp; She
could obtain no further certainty, for she knew that she must not
expect to see either her father or brother.&nbsp; There was a panic
throughout the city.&nbsp; All Paris imagined that the Huguenots
were on the point of rising and slaying all the Catholics, and,
with the savagery of alarmed cowardice, the citizens and the mob
were assisting the armed bands of the Dukes of Anjou and Guise to
complete the slaughter, dragging their lodgers from their
hiding-places, and denouncing all whom they suspected of reluctance
to mass and confession.&nbsp; But on the Monday, Diane was able to
send an urgent message to her father that he must come to speak
with her, for Mdlle. De Nid-de-Merle was extremely ill.&nbsp; She
would meet him in the garden after morning mass.</p>

<p>There accordingly, when she stepped forth pale, rigid, but
stately, with her large fan in her hand to serve as a parasol, she
met both him and her brother.&nbsp; She was for a moment sorry, for
she had much power over her father, while she was afraid of her
brother's sarcastic tongue and eye; she knew he never scrupled to
sting her wherever she was most sensitive, and she would have been
able to extract much more from her father in his absence.&nbsp;
France has never been without a tendency to produce the
tiger-monkey, or ferocious fop; and the GENUS was in its full
ascendancy under the sons of Catherine de Medicis, when the dregs
of Francois the First's PSEUDO-chivalry were not extinct--when
horrible, retaliating civil wars of extermination had made life
cheap; nefarious persecutions had hardened the heart and steeled
the eye, and the licentiousness promoted by the shifty Queen as one
of her instruments of government had darkened the whole
understanding.&nbsp; The most hateful heights of perfidy,
effeminacy, and hypocrisy were not reached till poor Charles IX.,
who only committed crimes on compulsion, was in his grave, and
Henry III. on the throne; but Narcisse de Ribaumont was one of the
choice companions of the latter, and after the night and day of
murder now stood before his sister with scented hair and
handkerchief--the last, laced, delicately held by a hand in an
embroidered glove--emerald pendants in his ears, a moustache
twisted into sharp points and turned up like an eternal sardonic
smile, and he led a little white poodle by a rose-coloured
ribbon.</p>

<p>'Well, sister,' he said, as he went, through the motions of
kissing her hand, and she embraced her father; 'so you don't know
how to deal with megrims and transports?'</p>

<p>'Father,' said Diane, not vouchsafing any attention, 'unless you
can send her some assurance of his life, I will not answer for the
consequences.'</p>

<p>Narcisse laughed: 'Take her this dog, with my compliments.&nbsp;
That is the way to deal with such a child as that.'</p>

<p>'You do not know what you say, brother,' answered Diane with
dignity.&nbsp; 'It goes deeper than that.'</p>

<p>'The deeper it goes, child,' said the elder Chevalier, 'the
better it is that she should be undeceived as soon as
possible.&nbsp; She will recover, and be amenable the sooner.'</p>

<p>'Then he lives, father?' exclaimed Diane.&nbsp; 'He lives,
though she is not to hear it--say----'</p>

<p>'What know I?' said the old man, evasively.&nbsp; 'On a night of
confusion many mischances are sure to occur!&nbsp; Lurking in the
palace at the very moment when there was a search for the
conspirators, it would have been a miracle had the poor young man
escaped.'</p>

<p>Diane turned still whiter.&nbsp; 'Then,' she said, 'that was why
you made Monsieur put Eustacie into the ballet, that they might not
go on Wednesday!'</p>

<p>"It was well hinted by you, daughter.&nbsp; We could not have
effectually stopped them on Wednesday without making a
scandal.'</p>

<p>'Once more,' said Diane, gasping, though still resolute; 'is not
the story told by Eustacie's woman false--that she saw him--
pistolled--by you, brother?'</p>

<p>'<i>Peste</i>!' cried Narcisse.&nbsp; 'Was the prying wench
there?&nbsp; I thought the little one might be satisfied that he
had neighbour's fare.&nbsp; No matter; what is done for one's <i>
beaux yeux</i> is easily pardoned--and if not, why, I have her all
the same!'</p>

<p>'Nevertheless, daughter,' said the Chevalier, gravely, 'the
woman must be silenced.&nbsp; Either she must be sent home, or
taught so to swear to having been mistaken, that <i>la petite</i>
may acquit your brother!&nbsp; But what now, my daughter?'</p>

<p>'She is livid!'&nbsp; exclaimed Narcisse, with his sneer.&nbsp;
'What, sir, did not you know she was smitten with the peach on the
top of a pole?'</p>

<p>'Enough, brother,' said Diane, recovering herself enough to
speak hoarsely, but with hard dignity.&nbsp; 'You have slain--you
need not insult, one whom you have lost the power of
understanding!'</p>

<p>'Shallow schoolboys certainly form no part of my study, save to
kick them down-stairs when they grow impudent,' said Narcisse,
coolly.&nbsp; 'It is only women who think what is long must be
grand.'</p>

<p>'Come, children, no disputes,' said the Chevalier.&nbsp; 'Of
course we regret that so fine a youth mixed himself up with the
enemies of the kingdom, like the stork among the sparrows.&nbsp;
Both Diane and I are sorry for the necessity; but remember, child,
that when he was interfering between your brother and his just
right of inheritance and destined wife, he could not but draw such
a fate on himself.&nbsp; Now all is smooth, the estates will be
united in their true head, and you--you too, my child, will be
provided for as suits your name.&nbsp; All that is needed is to
soothe the little one, so as to hinder her from making an
outcry--and silence the maid; my child will do her best for her
father's sake, and that of her family.'</p>

<p>Diane was less demonstrative than most of her
countrywomen.&nbsp; She had had time to recollect the uselessness
of giving vent to her indignant anguish, and her brother's derisive
look held her back.&nbsp; The family tactics, from force of habit,
recurred to her; she made no further objection to her father's
commands; but when her father and brother parted with her, she
tottered into the now empty chapel, threw herself down, with her
burning forehead on the stone step, and so lay for hours.&nbsp; It
was not in prayer.&nbsp; It was because it was the only place where
she could be alone.&nbsp; To her, heaven above and earth below
seemed alike full of despair, darkness, and cruel habitations, and
she lay like one sick with misery and repugnance to the life and
world that lay before her--the hard world that had quenched that
one fair light and mocked her pity.&nbsp; It was a misery of
solitude, and yet no thought crossed her of going to weep and
sympathize with the other sufferer.&nbsp; No; rivalry and jealousy
came in there!&nbsp; Eustacie viewed herself as his wife, and the
very thought that she had been deliberately preferred and had
enjoyed her triumph hardened Diane's heart against her.&nbsp; Nay,
the open violence and abandonment of her grief seemed to the more
restrained and concentrated nature of her elder a sign of
shallowness and want of durability; and in a certain contemptuous
envy at her professing a right to mourn, Diane never even
reconsidered her own resolution to play out her father's game,
consign Eustacie to her husband's murdered, and leave her to
console herself with bridal splendours and a choice of admirers
from all the court.</p>

<p>However, for the present Diane would rather stay away as much as
possible from the sick-bed of the poor girl; and when an
approaching step forced her to rouse herself and hurry away by the
other door of the chapel, she did indeed mount to the ladies'
bed-chamber, but only to beckon Veronique out of hearing and ask
for her mistress.</p>

<p>Just the same still, only sleeping to have feverish dreams of
the revolving wheel or the demons grappling her husband, refusing
all food but a little drink, and lying silent except for a few
moans, heedless who spoke or looked at her.</p>

<p>Diane explained that in that case it was needless to come to
her, but added, with the <i>vraisemblance</i> of falsehood in which
she had graduated in Catherine's school, 'Veronique, as I told you,
you were mistaken.'</p>

<p>'Ah, Mademoiselle, if M. le Baron lives, she will be cured at
once.'</p>

<p>'Silly girl,' said Diane, giving relief to her pent-up feeling
by asperity of manner, 'how could he live when you and your
intrigues got him into the palace on such a night?&nbsp; Dead he
is, OF COURSE; but it was your own treacherous, mischievous fancy
that laid it on my brother.&nbsp; He was far away with M. de Guise
at the attack on the Admiral.&nbsp; It was some of Monsieur's
grooms you saw.&nbsp; You remember she had brought him into a
scrape with Monsieur, and it was sure to be remembered.&nbsp; And
look you, if you repeat the other tale, and do not drive it out of
her head, you need not look to be long with her--no, nor at
home.&nbsp; My father will have no one there to cause a scandal by
an evil tongue.'</p>

<p>That threat convinced Veronique that she had been right; but
she, too, had learnt lessons at the Louvre, and she was too
diplomatic not to ask pardon for her blunder, promise to contradict
it when her mistress could listen, and express her satisfaction
that it was not the Chevalier Narcisse--for such things were not
pleasant, as she justly observed, in families.</p>

<p>About noon on the Tuesday the Louvre was unusually
tranquil.&nbsp; All the world had gone forth to a procession to
Notre Dame, headed by the King and all the royal family, to offer
thanksgiving for the deliverance of the country from the atrocious
conspiracy of the Huguenots.&nbsp; Eustacie's chamber was freed
from the bustle of all the maids of honour arraying themselves, and
adjusting curls, feathers, ruffs and jewels; and such relief as she
was capable of experiencing she felt in the quiet.</p>

<p>Veronique hoped she would sleep, and watched like a dragon to
guard against any disturbance, springing out with upraised finger
when a soft gliding step and rustling of brocade was heard.&nbsp;
'Does she sleep?' said a low voice; and Veronique, in the pale thin
face with tear-swollen eyes and light yellow hair, recognized the
young Queen.&nbsp; 'My good girl,' said Elisabeth, with almost a
beseeching gesture, 'let me see her.&nbsp; I do not know when again
I may be able.'</p>

<p>Veronique stood aside, with the lowest possible of curtseys,
just as her mistress with a feeble, weary voice murmured, 'Oh, make
them let me alone!'</p>

<p>'My poor, poor child,' said the Queen, bending over Eustacie,
while her brimming eyes let the tears fall fast, 'I will not
disturb you long, but I could not help it.'</p>

<p>'Her Majesty!' exclaimed Eustacie, opening wide her eyes in
amazement.</p>

<p>'My dear, suffer me here a little moment,' said the meek
Elisabeth, seating herself so as to bring her face near to
Eustacie's; 'I could not rest till I had seen how it was with you
and wept with you.'</p>

<p>'Ah, Madame, you can weep,' said Eustacie slowly, looking at the
Queen's heavy tearful eyes almost with wonder; 'but I do not weep
because I am dying, and that is better.'</p>

<p>'My dear, my dear, do not so speak!' exclaimed the gentle but
rather dull Queen.</p>

<p>'Is it wrong?&nbsp; Nay, so much the better--then I shall be
with HIM,' said Eustacie in the same feeble dreamy manner, as if
she did not understand herself, but a little roused by seeing she
had shocked her visitor.&nbsp; 'I would not be wicked.&nbsp; He was
all bright goodness and truth:&nbsp; but his does not seem to be
goodness that brings to heaven, and I do not want to be in the
heaven of these cruel false men--I think it would go round and
round.'&nbsp; She shut her eyes as if to steady herself, and that
moment seemed to give her more self-recollection, for looking at
the weeping, troubled visitor, she exclaimed, with more energy,
'Oh!&nbsp; Madame, it must be a dreadful fancy!&nbsp; Good men like
him cannot be shut into those fiery gates with the torturing
devils.'</p>

<p>'Heaven forbid!' exclaimed the Queen.&nbsp; 'My poor, poor
child, grieve not yourself thus.&nbsp; At my home, my Austrian
home, we do not speak in this dreadful way.&nbsp; My father loves
and honours his loyal Protestants, and he trusts that the good God
accepts their holy lives in His unseen Church, even though
outwardly they are separate from us.&nbsp; My German confessor ever
said so.&nbsp; Oh! Child, it would be too frightful if we deemed
that all those souls as well as bodies perished in these frightful
days.&nbsp; Myself, I believe that they have their reward for their
truth and constancy.'</p>

<p>Eustacie caught the Queen's hand, and fondled it with delight,
as though those words had veritably opened the gates of heaven to
her husband.&nbsp; The Queen went on in her slow gentle manner, the
very tone of which was inexpressibly soothing and sympathetic:
'Yes, and all will be clear there.&nbsp; No more violence.&nbsp; At
home our good men think so, and the King will think the same when
these cruel counsellors will leave him to himself; and I pray, I
pray day and night, that God will not lay this sin to his account,
but open his eyes to repent.&nbsp; Forgive him, Eustacie, and pray
for him too.'</p>

<p>'The King would have saved my husband, Madame,' returned
Eustacie.&nbsp; 'He bade him to his room.&nbsp; It was I, unhappy
I, who detained him, lest our flight should have been
hindered.'</p>

<p>The Queen in her turn kissed Eustacie's forehead with eager
gratitude.&nbsp; 'Oh, little one, you have brought a drop of
comfort to a heavy heart.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I could sometimes feel
you to be a happier wife than I, with your perfect trust in the
brave pure-spirited youth, unwarped by these wicked cruel
advisers.&nbsp; I loved to look at his open brow; it was so like
our bravest German Junkers.&nbsp; And, child, we thought, both of
us, to have brought about your happiness; but, ah!&nbsp; it has but
caused all this misery.'</p>

<p>'No, no, dearest Queen,' said Eustacie, 'this month with all its
woe has been joy--life!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I had rather lie here and
die for his loss than be as I was before he came.&nbsp; And
NOW--now, you have given him to me for all eternity--if but I am
fit to be with him!'</p>

<p>Eustacie had revived so much during the interview that the Queen
could not believe her to be in a dying state; but she continued
very ill, the low fever still hanging about her, and the faintness
continual.&nbsp; The close room, the turmoil of its many
inhabitants, and the impossibility of quiet also harassed her
greatly, and Elisabeth had little or no power of making any other
arrangements for her in the palace.&nbsp; Ladies when ill were
taken home, and this poor child had no home.&nbsp; The other maids
of honour were a gentler, simpler set than Catherine's squadron,
and were far from unkind; but between them and her, who had so
lately been the brightest child of them all, there now lay that
great gulf<i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Ich habe gelebt und
geliebet.'</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; That the little blackbird, as they used
to call her, should have been on the verge of running away with her
own husband was a half understood, amusing mystery discussed in
exaggerating prattle.&nbsp; This was hushed, indeed, in the
presence of that crushed, prostrate, silent sorrow; but there was
still an utter incapacity of true sympathy, that made the very
presence of so many oppressive, even when they were not in murmurs
discussing the ghastly tidings of massacres in other cities, and
the fate of acquaintances.</p>

<p>On that same day, the Queen sent for Diane to consult her about
the sufferer.&nbsp; Elisabeth longed to place her in her own
cabinet and attend on her herself; but she was afraid to do this,
as the unhappy King was in such a frenzied mood, and so constantly
excited by his brother and Guise, that it was possible that some
half-delirious complaint from poor Eustacie might lead to serious
consequences.&nbsp; Indeed, Elisabeth, though in no state to bear
agitation, was absorbed in her endeavour to prevent him from adding
blood to blood, and a few days later actually saved the lives&nbsp;
of the King of Navarre and Prince of Conde, by throwing herself
before him half-dressed, and tearing his weapon from his
hand.&nbsp; Her only hope was that if she should give him a son,
her influence for mercy would revive with his joy.&nbsp; Meantime
she was powerless, and she could only devise the sending the poor
little sufferer to a convent, where the nuns might tend her till
she was restored to health and composure.&nbsp; Diane acquiesced,
but proposed sending for her father, and he was accordingly
summoned.&nbsp; Diane saw him first alone, and both agreed that he
had better take Eustacie to Bellaise, where her aunt would take
good care of her, and in a few months she would no doubt be weary
enough of the country to be in raptures to return to Paris on any
terms.</p>

<p>Yet even as Diane said this, a sort of longing for the solitude
of the woods of Nid-de-Merle came over her, a recollection of the
good Sister Monique, at whose knee she had breathed somewhat of the
free pure air that her murdered cousin had brought with him; a
sense that there she could pour forth her sorrow.&nbsp; She offered
herself at once to go with Eustacie.</p>

<p>'No, no, my daughter,' said the Chevalier, 'that is
unnecessary.&nbsp; There is pleasanter employment for you.&nbsp; I
told you that your position was secured.&nbsp; Here is a brilliant
offer--M. de Selinville,'</p>

<p><i>'Le bonhomme de Selinville!'</i>&nbsp; exclaimed Diane,
feeling rather as if the compensation were like the little dog
offered to Eustacie.</p>

<p>'Know ye not that his two heretic nephews perished the other
night.&nbsp; He is now the head of his name, the Marquis, the only
one left of his house.'</p>

<p>'He begins early,' said Diane.</p>

<p>'An old soldier, my daughter, scarce stays to count the
fallen.&nbsp; He has no time to lose.&nbsp; He is sixty, with a
damaged constitution.&nbsp; It will be but the affair of a few
years, and then will my beautiful Marquise be free to choose for
herself.&nbsp; I shall go from the young Queen to obtain permission
from the Queen-mother.'</p>

<p>No question was asked.&nbsp; Diane never even thought objection
possible.&nbsp; It was a close to that present life which she had
begun to loathe; it gave comparative liberty.&nbsp; It would dull
and confuse her heart-sick pain, and give her a certain superiority
to her brother.&nbsp; Moreover, it would satisfy the old father,
whom she really loved.&nbsp; Marriage with a worn-out old man was a
simple step to full display for young ladies without fortune.</p>

<p>The Chevalier told Queen Elisabeth his purpose of placing his
niece in the family convent, under the care of her aunt, the
Abbess, in a foundation endowed by her own family on the borders of
her own estate.&nbsp; Elisabeth would have liked to keep her
nearer, but could not but own that the change to the scenes of her
childhood might be more beneficial than a residence in a nunnery at
Paris, and the Chevalier spoke of his niece with a tender
solicitude that gained the Queen's heart.&nbsp; She consented, only
stipulating that Eustacie's real wishes should be ascertained, and
herself again made the exertion of visiting the patient for the
purpose.</p>

<p>Eustacie had been partly dressed, and was lying as near as she
could to the narrow window.&nbsp; The Queen would not let her move,
but took her damp languid hand, and detailed her uncle's
proposal.&nbsp; It was plain that it was not utterly
distasteful.&nbsp; 'Soeur&nbsp; Monique,' she said, 'Soeur Monique
would sing hymns to me, and then I should not see the imps at
night.'</p>

<p>'Poor child!&nbsp; And you would like to go?&nbsp; You could
bear the journey?'</p>

<p>'It would be in the air!&nbsp; And then I should not smell
blood-- blood!'&nbsp; And her cheeks became whiter again, if
possible.</p>

<p>'Then you would not rather be at the Carmelites, or Maubuisson,
near me?'</p>

<p>'Ah!&nbsp; Madame, there would not be Soeur Monique.&nbsp; If
the journey would only make me die, as soon as I came, with Soeur
Monique to hush me, and keep off dreadful images!'</p>

<p>'Dear child, you should put away the thought of dying.&nbsp;
Maybe you are to live, that your prayers may win salvation for the
soul of him you love.'</p>

<p>'Oh, then!&nbsp; I should like to go into a convent so
strict--so strict, cried Eustacie, with renewed vigour.&nbsp;
'Bellaise is nothing like strict enough.&nbsp; Does your Majesty
indeed think that my prayers will aid him?'</p>

<p>'Alas!&nbsp; what hope could we have but in praying?' said
Elisabeth, with tears in her eyes.&nbsp; 'Little one, we will be
joined at least in our prayers and intercessions: thou wilt not
forget in thine one who yet lives, unhappier than all!'</p>

<p>'And, oh, my good, my holy Queen, will you indeed pray for
him--my husband?&nbsp; He was so good, his faith can surely not
long be reckoned against him.&nbsp; He did not believe in
Purgatory!&nbsp; Perhaps----'&nbsp; Then frowning with a difficulty
far beyond a fever-clouded brain, she concluded--'At least, orisons
may aid him!&nbsp; It is doing something for him!&nbsp; Oh, where
are my beads?--I can begin at once.'</p>

<p>The Queen put her arm round her, and together they said the <i>
De profundis</i>,--the Queen understood every word far more for the
living than the dead.&nbsp; Again Elisabeth had given new life to
Eustacie.&nbsp; The intercession for her husband was something to
live for, and the severest convent was coveted, until she was
assured that she would not be allowed to enter on any rule till she
had time to recover her health, and show the constancy of her
purpose by a residence at Bellaise.</p>

<p>Ere parting, however, the Queen bent over her, and colouring, as
if much ashamed of what she said, whispered--'Child, not a word of
the ceremony at Montpipeau!--you understand?&nbsp;&nbsp; The King
was always averse; it would bring him and me into dreadful trouble
with THOSE OTHERS, and alas! It makes no difference now.&nbsp; You
will be silent?'</p>

<p>And Eustacie signed her acquiescence, as indeed no difficulty
was made in her being regarded as the widow of the Baron de
Ribaumont, when she further insisted on procuring a widow's dress
before she quitted her room, and declared, with much dignity, that
she should esteem no person her friend who called her Mademoiselle
de Nid-de-Merle.&nbsp; To this the Chevalier de Ribaumont was
willing to give way; he did not care whether Narcisse married her
as Berenger's widow or as the separated maiden wife, and he thought
her vehement opposition and dislike would die away the faster the
fewer impediments were placed in her way.&nbsp; Both he and Diane
strongly discouraged any attempt on Narcisse's widow part at a
farewell interview; and thus unmolested, and under the constant
soothing influence of reciting her prayers, in the trust that they
were availing her husband, Eustacie rallied so much that about ten
day after the dreadful St. Bartholomew, in the early morning, she
was half-led half-carried down the stairs between her uncle and
Veronique. Her face was close muffled in her thick black veil, but
when she came to the foot of the first stairs where she had found
Berenger's cap, a terrible shuddering came on her; she again
murmured something about the smell of blood, and fell into a
swoon.</p>

<p>'Carry her on at once,' said Diane, who was following,--'there
will be not end to it if you do not remove her immediately.'</p>

<p>And thus shielded from the sight of Narcisse's intended
passionate gesture of farewell at the palace-door, Eustacie was
laid at full length on the seat of the great ponderous family
coach, where Veronique hardly wished to revive her till the eight
horses should have dragged her beyond the streets of Paris, with
their terrible associations, and the gibbets still hung with the
limbs of the murdered.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.&nbsp; THE BRIDEGROOM'S ARRIVAL</h3>

<p>The starling flew to his mother's window stane,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It whistled and it sang,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And aye, the ower word of the tune</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was 'Johnnie tarries lang.'--JOHNNIE OF BREDISLEE</p>

<p>There had been distrust and dissatisfaction at home for many a
day past.&nbsp; Berenger could hardly be censured for loving his
own wife, and yet his family were by not means gratified by the
prospect of his bringing home a little French Papist, of whom Lady
Thistlewood remembered nothing good.</p>

<p>Lucy was indignantly fetched home by her stepmother, who
insisted on treating her with extreme pity as a deserted maiden,
and thus counteracting Aunt Cecily's wise representations, that
there never should, and therefore never could, have been anything
save fraternal affection between the young people, and that pity
was almost an insult to Lucy.&nbsp; The good girl herself was made
very uncomfortable by there demonstrations, and avoided them as
much as possible, chiefly striving in her own gentle way to prepare
her little sisters to expect numerous charms in brother Berenger's
wife, and heartily agreeing with Philip that Berenger knew his own
mind best.</p>

<p>'And at any rate,' quoth Philip, 'we'll have the best bonfire
that ever was seen in the country! Lucy, you'll coax my father to
give us a tar-barrel!'</p>

<p>The tar-barrel presided over a monstrous pile of fagots, and the
fisher-boys were promised a tester to whoever should first bring
word to Master Philip that the young lord and lady were in the
creek.</p>

<p>Philip gave his pony no rest, between the lock-out on the downs
and the borders of the creek; but day after day passed, and still
the smacks from Jersey held no person worth mentioning; and still
the sense of expectation kept Lucy starting at every sound, and
hating herself for her own folly.</p>

<p>At last Philip burst into Combe Manor, fiery red with riding and
consternation.&nbsp; 'Oh! father, father, Paul Duval's boat is come
in, and he says that the villain Papists have butchered every
Protestant in France.'</p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke's asseveration was of the strongest, that he did
not believe a word of it.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he took his horse and
rode down to interrogate Paul Duval, and charge him not to spread
the report was in the air.&nbsp; He went to the Hall, and the
butler met him with a grave face, and took him to the study, where
Lord Walwyn was sitting over letter newly received from London,
giving hints from the Low Countries of bloody work in France.&nbsp;
And when he returned to his home, his wife burst out upon him in
despair.&nbsp; Here had they been certainly killing her poor
buy.&nbsp; Not a doubt that he was dead.&nbsp; All from this
miserable going to France, that had been quite against her
will.</p>

<p>Stoutly did Sir Marmaduke persevere in his disbelief; but every
day some fresh wave of tidings floated in.&nbsp; Murder wholesale
had surely been perpetrated.&nbsp; Now came stories of death-bells
at Rouen from the fishermen on the coast; now markets and petty
sessions discussed the foul slaughter of the Ambassador and his
household; truly related how the Queen had put on mourning, and
falsely that she had hung the French Ambassador, La Mothe
Feneon.&nbsp; And Burleigh wrote to his old friend from London,
that some horrible carnage had assuredly taken place, and that no
news had yet been received of Sir Francis Walsingham or of his
suite.</p>

<p>All these days seems so many years taken from the vital power of
Lord Walwyn.&nbsp; Not only had his hopes and affections would
themselves closely around his grandson, but he reproached himself
severely with having trusted him in his youth and inexperience
among the seductive perils of Paris.&nbsp; The old man grieved over
the promising young life cut off, and charged on himself the loss
and grief to the women, whose stay he had trusted Berenger would
have been.&nbsp; He said little, but his hand and head grew more
trembling; he scarcely ate or slept, and seemed to waste from a
vigorous elder to a feeble being in the extremity of old age, till
Lady Walwyn had almost ceased to think of her grandson in her
anxiety for her husband.</p>

<p>Letters came at last.&nbsp; The messenger despatched by Sir
Francis Walsingham had not been able to proceed till the ways had
become safe, and he had then been delayed; but on his arrival his
tidings were sent down.&nbsp; There were letters both from Sir
Francis Walsingham and from heart-broken Mr. Adderley, both to the
same effect, with all possible praises of the young Baron de
Ribaumont, all possible reproach to themselves for having let him
be betrayed, without even a possibility of recovering his remains
for honourable burial.&nbsp; Poor Mr. Adderley further said that
Mr. Sidney, who was inconsolable for the loss of his friend, had
offered to escort him to the Low Countries, whence he would make
his way to England, and would present himself at Hurst Walwyn, if
his Lordship could endure the sight of his creature who had so
miserably failed in his trust.</p>

<p>Lord Walwyn read both letters twice through before he
spoke.&nbsp; Then he took off his spectacles, laid them down, and
said calmly, 'God's will be done.&nbsp; I thank God that my boy was
blameless.&nbsp; Better they slew him than sent him home tainted
with their vices.'</p>

<p>The certainty, such as it was, seemed like repose after the
suspense.&nbsp; They knew to what to resign themselves, and even
Lady Thistlewood's tempestuous grief had so spent itself that late
in the evening the family sat round the fire in the hall, the old
lord dozing as one worn out with sorrow, the others talking in
hushed tones of that bright boyhood, that joyous light quenched in
the night of carnage.</p>

<p>The butler slowly entered the hall, and approached Sir
Marmaduke, cautiously.&nbsp; 'Can I speak with you, sir?'</p>

<p>'What is it, Davy?' demanded the lady, who first caught the
words.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'What did you say?'</p>

<p>'Madam, it is Humfrey Holt!'</p>

<p>Humfrey Holt was the head of the grooms who had gone with
Berenger; and there was a general start and suppressed
exclamation.&nbsp; 'Humfrey Hold!' said Lord Walwyn, feebly drawing
himself to sit upright, 'hath he, then, escaped?'</p>

<p>'Yea, my Lord,' said Davy, 'and he brings news of my young
Lord'</p>

<p>'Alack! Davy,' said Lady Walwyn, 'such news had been precious a
while ago.'</p>

<p>'Nay, so please your Ladyship, it is better than you deem.&nbsp;
Humfrey says my young Lord is yet living.'</p>

<p>'Living! shrieked Lady&nbsp; Thistlewood, starting up.&nbsp;
'Living!&nbsp; My son! and where?'</p>

<p>'They are bearing him home, my Lady,' said the butler; 'but I
fear me, by what Humfrey says, that it is but in woeful case.'</p>

<p>'Bringing him home!&nbsp; Which way?'&nbsp; Philip darted off
like an arrow from the bow.&nbsp; Sir Marmaduke hastily demanded if
aid were wanted; and Lady Walwyn, interpreting the almost inaudible
voice of her husband, bade that Humfrey should be called in to tell
his own story.</p>

<p>Hands were held out in greeting, and blessings murmured, as the
groom entered, looking battered and worn, and bowing low in
confusion at being thus unusually conspicuous, and having to tell
his story to the head and body, and slashed about the face so as it
is a shame to see.&nbsp; Nor hath he done aught these three weary
weeks but moan from time to time so as it is enough to break one's
heart to hear him; and I fear me 'tis but bringing him home to
die.'</p>

<p>'Even so, God be thanked; and you too, honest Humfrey,' said
Lady Walwyn.'&nbsp; 'Let us hear when and how this deed was
done.'</p>

<p>'Why, that, my Lord, I can't so well say, being that I was not
with him; more's the pity, or I'd have known the reason why, or
even they laid a finger on him.&nbsp; But when Master Landry, his
French foster-brother, comes, he will resolve you in his own
tongue.&nbsp; I can't parleyvoo with him, but he's an honest rogue
for a Frenchman, and 'twas he brought off my young Lord. You see we
were all told to be abroad the little French craft.</p>

<p>Master Landry took me down and settled it all with the master, a
French farmer fellow that came a horse-dealing to Paris.&nbsp; I
knew what my young Lord was after, but none of the other varlets
did; and I went down and made as decent a place as I could between
decks.&nbsp; My Lord and Master Landry were gone down to the court
meantime, and we were to lie off till we heard a whistle like a
mavis on the bank, then come and take them aboard.&nbsp; Well, we
waited and waited, and all the lights were out, and not a sound did
we hear till just an hour after midnight.&nbsp; Then a big bell
rang out, not like a decent Christianable bell, but a great clash,
then another, and a lot of strokes enough to take away one's
breath.&nbsp; Then half the windows were lighted up, and we heard
shots, and screeches, and splashes, till, as I said to Jack
Smithers, 'twas as if one half the place was murthering the
other.&nbsp; The farmer got frightened, and would have been off;
but when I saw what he was at, "No," says I, "not an inch do we
budge without news of my Lord."&nbsp; So Jack stood by the rope,
and let them see that 'twas as much as their life was worth to try
to unmoor.&nbsp; Mercy, what a night it was!&nbsp; Shrieks and
shouts, and shots and howls, here, there, and everywhere, and
splashes into the rive; and by and by we saw the poor murthered
creatures come floating by.&nbsp; The farmer, he had some words
with one of the boats near, and I heard somewhat of Huguenot and
Hereteek, and I knew that was what they called good
Protestants.&nbsp; Then up comes the farmer with his sons looking
mighty ugly at us, and signing that unless we let them be off
'twould be set ashore for us; and we began to think as how we had
best be set ashore, and go down the five of us to see if we could
stand by my young Lord in some strait, or give notice to my Lord
Ambassador.'</p>

<p>'God reward you!' exclaimed Lady Walwyn.</p>

<p>'Twas only our duty, my Lady,' gruffly answered Humfrey; 'but
just as Hal had got on the quay, what should I see but Master
Landry coming down the street with my young Lord in his back!&nbsp;
I can tell you he was well-nigh spent; and just then half a dozen
butcherly villains came out on him, bawling, "Tu-y!&nbsp; tu-y!"
which it seems means "kill, kill."&nbsp; He turned about and showed
them that he had got a white sleeve and white cross in his bonnet,
like them, the rascals, giving them to understand that he was only
going to throw the corpse into the river. I doubted him then
myself; but he caught sight of us, and in his fashion of talk with
us, called out to us to help, for there was life still.&nbsp; So
two of us took my Lord, and the other three gave the beggarly
French cut-throats as good as they meant for us; while Landry
shouted to the farmer to wait, and we got aboard, and made right
away down the river.&nbsp; But never a word has the poor young
gentleman spoken, though Master Landry has done all a barber or a
sick-nurse could do; and he got us past the cities by showing the
papers in my Lord's pocket, so that we got safe to the farmer's
place.&nbsp; There we lay till we could get a boat to Jersey, and
thence again home; and maybe my young Lord will mend now Mistress
Cecily will have the handing of him.'</p>

<p>'That is it the wisest Hands, good Humfrey,' said Lord Walwyn,
as the tears of feeble age flowed down his cheeks.&nbsp; 'May He
who hath brought the lad safely so far spare him yet, and raise him
up.&nbsp; But whether he live or die, you son and daughter
Thistlewood will look that the faithfulness of Humfrey Holt and his
comrades be never forgotten or unrewarded.'</p>

<p>Humfrey again muttered something about no more than his duty;
but by this time sounds were heard betokening the approach of the
melancholy procession, who, having been relieved by a relay of
servants sent at once from the house, were bearing home the wounded
youth.&nbsp; Philip first of all dashed in hurrying and
stumbling.&nbsp; He had been unprepared by hearing Humfrey's
account, and, impetuous and affectionate as he was, was entirely
unrestrained, and flinging himself on his knees with the
half-audible words, 'Oh!&nbsp; Lucy!&nbsp; Lucy! He is as good as
dead!' hid his face between his arms on his sister's lap, and
sobbed with the abandonment of a child, and with all his youthful
strength; so much adding to the consternation and confusion, that,
finding all Lucy's gentle entreaties vain, his father at last
roughly pulled up his face by main force, and said, 'Philip, hold
your tongue!&nbsp; Are we to have you on our hands as well as my
Lady?&nbsp; I shall send you home this moment!&nbsp; Let your
sister go.'</p>

<p>This threat reduced the boy to silence.&nbsp; Lucy, who was
wanted to assist in preparing Berenger's room, disengaged herself;
but he remained in the same posture, his head buried on the seat of
the chair, and the loud weeping only forcibly stifled by forcing
his handkerchief into his mouth, as if he had been in violent
bodily pain.&nbsp; Nor did he venture again to look up as the cause
of all his distress was slowly carried into the hall, corpse-like
indeed.&nbsp; The bearers had changed several times, all but a
tall, fair Norman youth, who through the whole transit had
supported the head, endeavouring to guard it from shocks.&nbsp;
When the mother and the rest came forward, he made a gesture to
conceal the face, saying in French, 'Ah! Mesdames; this is no sight
for you.'</p>

<p>Indeed the head and face were almost entirely hidden by
bandages, and it was not till Berenger had been safely deposited on
a large carved bed that the anxious relatives were permitted to
perceive the number and extent of his hurts; and truly it was only
by the breath, the vital warmth, and the heavy moans when he was
disturbed, or the dressings of the wounds were touched, that showed
him still to be a living man.&nbsp; There proved to be no less than
four wounds--a shot through the right shoulder, the right arm also
broken with a terrible blow with a sword, a broad gash from the
left temple to the right ear, and worse than all, <i>'le baiser
d'Eustacie</i>,' a bullet wound where the muzzle of the pistol had
absolutely been so close as to have burnt and blackened the cheek;
so that his life was, as Osbert averred, chiefly owing to the
assassin's jealousy of his personal beauty, which had directed his
shot to the cheek rather than the head; and thus, though the bullet
had terribly shattered the upper jaw and roof of the mouth, and had
passed out through the back of the head, there was a hope that it
had not penetrated the seat of life or reason.&nbsp; The other gash
on the face was but a sword-wound, and though frightful to look at,
was unimportant, compared with the first wound with the pistol-shot
in the shoulder, with the arm broken and further injured by having
served to suspend him round Osbert's neck; but it was altogether so
appalling a sight, that it was no wonder that Sis Marmaduke
muttered low but deep curses on the cowardly ruffians; while his
wife wept in grief as violent, though more silent, than her
stepson's, and only Cecily gathered the faintest ray of hope.&nbsp;
The wounds had been well cared for, the arm had been set, the hair
cut away, and lint and bandages applied with a skill that surprised
her, till she remembered that Landry Osbert had been bred up in
preparation to be Berenger's valet, and thus to practise those
minor arts of surgery then required in a superior
body-servant.&nbsp; For his part, though his eyes looked red, and
his whole person exhausted by unceasing watching, he seemed unable
to relinquish the care of his master for a moment, and her nunnery
French would not have perceived her tender touch and ready
skill.&nbsp; These were what made him consent to leave his post
even for a short meal, and so soon as he had eaten it he was called
to Lord Walwyn to supply the further account which Humfrey had been
unable to give.&nbsp; He had waited, he explained, with a lackey, a
friend of his in the palace, till he became alarmed by the influx
of armed men, wearing white crosses and shirt-sleeves on their left
arms, but his friend had assured him that his master had been
summoned to the royal bedchamber, where he would be as safe as in
church; and obtaining from Landry Osbert himself a perfectly true
assurance of being a good Catholic, had supplied him with the
badges that were needful for security.&nbsp; It was just then that
Madame's maid crept down to his waiting-place with the intelligence
that her mistress had been bolted in, and after a short
consultation they agreed to go and see whether M. le Baron were
indeed waiting, and, if he were, to warn him of the suspicious
state of the lower regions of the palace.</p>

<p>They were just in time to see, but not to prevent the attack
upon their young master; and while Veronique fled, screaming,
Landry Osbert, who had been thrown back on the stairs in her sudden
flight, recovered himself and hastened to his master. The
murderers, after their blows had been struck, had hurried along the
corridor to join the body of assassins, whose work they had in
effect somewhat anticipated.&nbsp; Landry, full of rage and
despair, was resolved at least to save his foster-brother's corpse
from further insult, and bore it down-stairs in his arms.&nbsp; On
the way, he perceived that life was not yet extinct, and resolving
to become doubly cautious, he sought in the pocket for the purse
that had been well filled for the flight, and by the persuasive
argument of gold crowns, obtained egress from the door-keeper of
the postern, where Berenger hoped to have emerged in a far
different manner.&nbsp; It was a favourable moment, for the main
body of the murderers were at that time being poster in the court
by the captain of the guard, ready to massacre the gentlemen of the
King of Navarre's suite, and he was therefore unmolested by any
claimant of the plunders of the apparent corpse he bore on his
shoulders.&nbsp; The citizens of Paris who had been engaged in
their share of the murders for more than an hour before the tragedy
began in the Louvre, frequently beset him on his way to the quay,
and but for the timely aid of his English comrades, he would hardly
have brought off his foster-brother safely.</p>

<p>The pass with which King Charles had provided Berenger for
himself and his followers when his elopement was first planned,
enabled Osbert to carry his whole crew safely past all the stations
where passports were demanded.&nbsp; He had much wished to procure
surgical aid at Rouen, but learning from the boatmen on the river
that the like bloody scenes were there being enacted, he had decide
on going on to his master's English home as soon as possible,
merely trusting to his own skill by the way; and though it was the
slightest possible hope, yet the healthy state of the wounds, and
the mere fact of life continuing, had given him some faint trust
that there might be a partial recovery.</p>

<p>Lord Walwyn repeated his agitated thanks and praises for such
devotion to his grandson.</p>

<p>Osbert bower, laid his hand on his heart, and
replied--'Monseigneur is good, but what say I?&nbsp; Monsieur le
Baron is my foster-brother!&nbsp; Say that, and all is said in one
word.'</p>

<p>He was then dismissed, with orders to take some rest, but he
obstinately refused all commands in French or English to go to bed,
and was found some time after fast asleep.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.&nbsp; SWEET HEART</h3>

<p>Ye hae marred a bonnier face than your ain.</p>

<p>DYING WORDS OF THE BONNIE EARL OF MORAY</p>

<p>One room at Hurst Walwyn, though large, wainscoted, and well
furnished, bore as pertinaciously the air of a cell as the
appearance of Sister Cecily St. John continued like that of a
nun.&nbsp; There was a large sunny oriel, in which a thrush sang
merrily in a wicker cage; and yet the very central point and
leading feature of the room was the altar-like table, covered with
rich needlework, with a carved ebony crucifix placed on it, and on
the wall above, quaint and stiff, but lovely-featured, delicately
tinted pictures of Our Lady in the centre, and of St. Anne and St.
Cecilia on either side, with skies behind of most ethereal blue,
and robes tenderly trimmed with gold.&nbsp; A little shrine of
purple spar, with a crystal front, contained a fragment of sacred
bone; a silver shell help holy water, perpetuated from some blessed
by Bishop Ridley.</p>

<p>'With velvet bound and broidered o'er, Her breviary book'&nbsp;
Lay open at 'Sext,' and there, too, lay with its three marks at the
Daily Lessons, the Bishop's Bible, and the Common Prayer beside
it.</p>

<p>The elder Baron de Ribaumont had never pardoned Cecily his
single glance at that table, and had seriously remonstrated with
his father-in-law for permitting its existence, quoting Rachel,
Achan, and Maachah.&nbsp; Yet he never knew of the hair-cloth
smock, the discipline, the cord and sack-cloth that lay stored in
the large carved awmry, and were secretly in use on every fast or
vigil, not with any notion of merit, but of simple obedience, and
with even deeper comprehension and enjoyment of their spiritual
significance, of which, in her cloister life, she had comprehended
little.</p>

<p>It was not she, however, who knelt with bowed head and clasped
hands before the altar-table, the winter sunbeams making the
shadows of the ivy sprays dance upon the deep mourning dress and
pale cheek.&nbsp; The eyelashes were heavy with tear-drops, and
veiled eyes that had not yet attained to the region of calm, like
the light quivering of the lips showed that here was the beginning
of the course of trial through which serenity might be won, and for
ever.</p>

<p>By and by the latch was raise, and Cecily came forward.&nbsp;
Lucy rose quickly to her feet, and while giving and returning a
fond embrace, asked with her eyes the question that Cecily
answered, 'Still in the same lethargy.&nbsp; The only shade of
sense that I have seen is an unclosing of the eyes, a wistful look
whenever the door opened, and a shiver through all his frame
whenever the great bell rings, till my Lord forbade it to be
sounded.'</p>

<p>'That frightful bell that the men told us of,' said Lucy,
shuddering; 'oh, what a heart that murderess must have had!'</p>

<p>'Hold, Lucy!&nbsp; How should we judge her, who may at this
moment be weeping in desolation?'</p>

<p>Lucy looked up astonished.&nbsp; 'Aunt,' she said, 'you have
been so long shut up with him that you hardly can have heard
all-how she played fast and loose, and for the sake of a mere
pageant put off the flight from the time when it would have been
secure even until that dreadful eve!'</p>

<p>'I know it,' said Cecily.&nbsp; 'I fear me much that her sin has
been great; yet, Lucy, it were better to pray for her than to talk
wildly against her.'</p>

<p>'Alas!' murmured Lucy, 'I could bear it and glory in it when it
seemed death for the faith's sake, but,' and the tears burst out,
'to find he was only trapped and slain for the sake of a faithless
girl--and that he should love her still.'</p>

<p>'She is his wife,' said Cecily.&nbsp; 'Child, from my soul I
grieve for you, but none the less must I, if no other will, keep
before your eyes that our Berenger's faith belongs solely to
her.'</p>

<p>'You--you never would have let me forget it,' said Lucy. 'Indeed
I am more maidenly when not alone with you!&nbsp; I know verily
that he is loyal, and that my hatred to her is more than is
meet.&nbsp; I will--I will pray for her, but I would that you were
in your convent still, and that I could hide me there.'</p>

<p>'That were scarce enough,' said Cecily.&nbsp; 'One sister we had
who had fled to our house to hide her sorrows for her betrothed had
wedded another.&nbsp; She took her sorrows for her vocation, strove
to hurry on her vows, and when they were taken, she chafed and
fretted under them.&nbsp; It was she who wrote to the commissioner
the letter that led to the visitation of our house, and, moreover,
she was the only one of us who married.'</p>

<p>'To her own lover?'</p>

<p>'No, to a brewer at Winchester!&nbsp; I say not that you could
ever be like poor sister Bridget, but only that the cloister has no
charm to still the heart--prayer and duty can do as much without as
within.'</p>

<p>'When we deemed her worthy, I was glad of his happiness,' said
Lucy, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'You did, my dear, and I rejoiced.&nbsp; Think now how grievous
it must be with her, if she, as I fear she may, yielded her heart
to those who told her that to ensnare him was her duty, or if
indeed she were as much deceived as he.'</p>

<p>'Then she will soon be comforted,' said Lucy, still with some
bitterness in her voice; bitterness of which she herself was
perhaps conscious, for suddenly dropping in her knees, she hid her
face, and cried. 'Oh, help me to pray for her, Aunt Cecily, and
that I may do her wrong no more!'</p>

<p>And Cecily, in her low conventual chant, sang, almost under her
breath, the noonday Latin hymn, the words of which, long familiar
to Lucy, had never as yet so come home to her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Quench Thou the fires of heat and
strife,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wasting fever of the heart;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From perils guard our feeble life,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to our souls Thy help impart.'</p>

<p>Cecily's judgment would have been thought weakly charitable by
all the rest of the family. Mr. Adderley had been forwarded by Sir
Francis Walsingham like a bale of goods, and arriving in a mood of
such self-reproach as would be deemed abject, by persons used to
the modern relations between noblemen and their chaplains, was
exhilarated by the unlooked-for comfort of finding his young charge
at least living, and in his grandfather's house.&nbsp; From his
narrative, Walsingham's letter, and Osbert's account, Lord Walwyn
saw no reason to doubt that the Black Ribaumonts had thought that
massacre a favourable moment for sweeping the only survivor of the
White or elder branch away, and that not only had royalty lent
itself to the cruel project, but that as Diane de Ribaumont had
failed as a bait, the young espoused wife had herself been employed
to draw him into the snare, and secure his presence at the
slaughter-house, away from his safe asylum at the Ambassador's or
even in the King's garde-robe.&nbsp; It was an unspeakably
frightful view to take of the case, yet scarcely worse than the
reality of many of the dealings of those with whom the poor young
girl had been associated: certainly not worse than the crimes, the
suspicion of which was resting on the last dowager Queen of France;
and all that could be felt by the sorrowing family, was comfort
that at least corruption of mind had either not been part of the
game, or had been unsuccessful, and, by all testimony, the victim
was still the same innocent boy.&nbsp; This was all their relief,
while for days, for weeks, Berenger de Ribaumont lay in a trance or
torpor between life and death.&nbsp; Sometimes, as Cecily had said,
his eyes turned with a startled wistfulness towards the door, and
the sound of a bell seemed to thrill him with a start of agony; but
for the most part he neither appeared to see or hear, and a few
moans were the only sounds that escaped him.&nbsp; The Queen, in
her affection for her old friend, and her strong feeling for the
victims of the massacre, sent down the court physician, who turned
him about, and elicited sundry heavy groans, but could do no more
than enjoin patient waiting on the beneficent powers of nature in
early youth.&nbsp; His visit produced one benefit, namely, the
strengthening of Cecily St.&nbsp; John's hands against the charms,
elixirs, and nostrums with which Lady Thistlewood's friends
supplied her,--plasters from the cunning women of Lyme Regis, made
of powder of giant's bones, and snakes prayed into stone by St.
Aldhelm, pills of live woodlice, and fomentations of living
earthworms and spiders.&nbsp; Great was the censure incurred by
Lady Walwyn for refusing to let such remedies be tried on HER
grandson.&nbsp; And he was so much more her child than his
mother's, that Dame Annora durst do no more than maunder.</p>

<p>In this perfect rest, it seemed as if after a time 'the powers
of nature' did begin to rally, there were appearances of healing
about the wounds, the difference between sleeping and waking became
more evident, the eyes lost the painful, half-closed, vacant look,
but were either shut or opened with languid recognition.&nbsp; The
injuries were such as to exclude him from almost every means of
expression, the wound in his mouth made speech impossible, and his
right arm was not available for signs.&nbsp; It was only the
clearness of his eyes, and their response to what was said, that
showed that his mind was recovering tone, and then he seemed only
alive to the present, and to perceive nothing but what related to
his suffering and its alleviations.&nbsp; The wistfulness that had
shown itself at first was gone, and even when he improved enough to
establish a language of signs with eye, lip, or left hand, Cecily
became convinced that he has little or no memory of recent
occurrences, and that finding himself at home among familiar faces,
his still dormant perceptions demanded no further explanation.</p>

<p>This blank was the most favourable state for his peace and for
his recovery, and it was of long duration, lasting even till he had
made so much progress that he could leave his bed, and even speak a
few words, though his weakness was much prolonged by the great
difficulty with which he could take nourishment.&nbsp; About two
winters before, Cecily had successfully nursed him through a severe
attack of small-pox, and she thought that he confounded his present
state with the former illness, when he had had nearly the same
attendants and surroundings as at present; and that his faculties
were not yet roused enough to perceive the incongruity.</p>

<p>Once or twice he showed surprise at visits from his mother or
Philip, who had then been entirely kept away from him, and about
Christmas he brightened so much, and awoke to things about him so
much more fully, that Cecily thought the time of recollection could
not be much longer deferred.&nbsp; Any noise, however, seemed so
painful to him, that the Christmas festivities were held at Combe
Manor instead of Hurst Walwyn; only after church, Sir Marmaduke and
Lady Thistlewood came in to make him a visit, as he sat in a large
easy-chair by his bedroom-fire, resting after having gone through
as much of the rites of the day as he was able for, with Mr.
Adderlay.&nbsp; The room looked very cheerful with the bright
wood-fire on the open hearth, shining on the gay tapestry hangings,
and the dark wood of the carved bed.&nbsp; The evergreen-decked
window shimmered with sun shine, and even the patient, leaning back
among crimson cushions, though his face and head were ghastly
enough wherever they were not covered with patches and bandages,
still had a pleasant smile with lip and eye to thank his stepfather
for his cheery wishes of 'a merry Christmas, at least one better in
health.'</p>

<p>'I did not bring the little wenches, Berenger, lest they should
weary you,' said his mother.</p>

<p>Berenger looked alarmed, and said with the indistinctness with
which he always spoke, 'Have they caught it?&nbsp; Are they
marked?'</p>

<p>'No, no, not like you, may boy,' said Sir Marmaduke,
sufficiently aware of Berenger's belief to be glad to keep it up,
and yet obliged to walk to the window to hide his diversion at the
notion of his little girls catching the contagion of sword-gashes
and bullet-wounds.&nbsp; Dame Annora prattled on, 'But they have
sent you their Christmas gifts by me. Poor children, they have long
been busied with them, and I fancy Lucy did half herself.&nbsp;
See, this kerchief is hemmed by little Dolly, and here are a pair
of bands and cuffs to match, that Nanny and Bessy have been
broidering with their choicest stitchery.'</p>

<p>Berenger smile, took, expressed admiration by gesture, and then
said in a dreamy, uncertain manner, 'Methought I had some gifts for
them;' then looking round the room, his eye fell on a small
brass-bound casket which had travelled with him to hold his
valuables; he pointed to it with a pleased look, as Sir Marmaduke
lifted it and placed it on a chair by his side.&nbsp; The key, a
small ornamental brass one, was in his purse, not far off, and Lady
Thistlewood was full of exceeding satisfaction at the unpacking not
only of foreign gifts, but, as she hoped, of the pearls; Cecily
meantime stole quietly in, to watch that her patient was not
over-wearied.</p>

<p>He was resuming the use of his right arm, though it was still
weak and stiff, and he evidently had an instinct against letting
any one deal with that box but himself; he tried himself to unlock
it, and though forced to leave this to Sir Marmaduke, still leant
over it when opened, as if to prevent his mother's curious glances
from penetrating its recesses, and allowed no hands near it but his
own.&nbsp; He first brought out a pretty feather fan, saying as he
held it to his mother, 'For Nan, I promised it.&nbsp; It was bought
at the Halles,' he added, more dreamily.</p>

<p>Then again he dived, and brought out a wax medallion of Our Lady
guarded by angels, and made the sign that always brought Cecily to
him.&nbsp; He held it up to her with a puzzled smile, saying, 'They
thought me a mere Papist for buying it--M. de Teligny, I think it
was.'</p>

<p>They had heard how the good and beloved Teligny had been shot
down on the roof of his father-in-law's house, by rabid assassins,
strangers to his person, when all who knew him had spared him, from
love to his gentle nature; and the name gave a strange thrill.</p>

<p>He muttered something about 'Pedlar,--Montpipeau,'--and still
continued.&nbsp; Then came a small silver casket, diffusing an
odour of attar of roses--he leant back in his chair--and his mother
would have taken it from him, supposing him overcome by the scent,
but he held it fast and shook his head, saying, "For Lucy,--but she
must give it herself.&nbsp; She gave up any gift for herself for
it--she said we needed no love-tokens.' And he closed his
eyes.&nbsp; Dame Annora plunged into the unpacking, and brought out
a pocket-mirror with enamelled cupids in the corner, addressed to
herself; and then came upon Berenger's own.</p>

<p>Again came a fringed pair of gloves among the personal jewellery
such as gentlemen were wont to wear, the rings, clasps and brooches
he had carried from home.&nbsp; Dame Angora's impatience at last
found vent in the exclamation, 'The pearls, son; I do not see the
chaplet of pearls.'</p>

<p>'She had them, 'answered Berenger, in a matter-of-fact tone, 'to
wear at the masque.'</p>

<p>'She----'</p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke's great hand choked, as it were, the query on his
wife's lips, unseen by her son, who, as if the words had touched
some chord, was more eagerly seeking in the box, and presently drew
out a bow of carnation ribbon with a small piece of paper full of
pin-holes attached to it.&nbsp; At once he carried it to his lips,
kissed it fervently, and then, sinking back in his chair, seemed to
be trying to gather up the memory that had prompted the impulse,
knitted his brows together, and then suddenly exclaimed, 'Where is
she?'</p>

<p>His mother tried the last antecedent.&nbsp; 'Lucy? She shall
come and thank you to-morrow.'</p>

<p>He shook his head with a vehement negative, beckoned Cecily
impatiently, and said earnestly, 'Is it the contagion?&nbsp; Is she
sick?&nbsp; I will go to her.'</p>

<p>Cecily and Sir Marmaduke both replied with a 'No, no!' and were
thankful, though in much suspense at the momentary pause, while
again he leant back on the cushions, looked steadily at the
pin-holes, that formed themselves into the word 'Sweet heart,' then
suddenly began to draw up the loose sleeve of his wrapping-gown and
unbutton the wristband of his right sleeve.&nbsp; His mother tried
to help him, asking if he had hurt or tired his arm.&nbsp; They
would have been almost glad to hear that it was so, but he shook
her off impatiently, and the next moment had a view of the freshly
skinned over, but still wide and gaping gash on his arm.&nbsp; He
looked for a brief space, and said, 'It is a sword-cut,'</p>

<p>'Truly it is, lad,' said Sir Marmaduke, 'and a very bad one,
happily whole!&nbsp; Is this the first time you have seen it?'</p>

<p>He did not answer, but covered his eyes with his hand, and
presently burst out again, 'Then it is no dream?&nbsp; Sir--have I
been to France?'</p>

<p>'Yes, my son, you have,' said Sir Marmaduke, gently, and with
more tenderness than could have been looked for; 'but what passed
there is much better viewed as a dream, and cast behind your back,'
Berenger had, while he spoke, taken up the same little mirror where
he had once admired himself; and as he beheld the scar and plaster
that disfigured his face, with a fresh start of recollection,
muttered over, <i>'"Barbouiller ce chien de visage"</i> --ay, so he
said.&nbsp; I felt the pistol's muzzle touch!&nbsp; Narcisse!&nbsp;
Has God had mercy on me?&nbsp; I prayed Him.&nbsp; Ah! <i>"le
baiser d'Eustacie"</i> --so he said.&nbsp; I was waiting in the
dark.&nbsp; Why did he come instead of her?&nbsp; Oh! father, where
is she?'</p>

<p>It was a sore task, but Sir Marmaduke went bravely and bluntly,
though far from unkindly, to the point: 'She remains with her
friends in France.'</p>

<p>There the youth's look of utter horror and misery shocked and
startled them all, and he groaned rather than said, 'Left
there!&nbsp; Left to them!&nbsp; What have I done to leave her
there?'</p>

<p>'Come, Berenger, this will not serve,' said his mother, trying
to rouse and cheer him.&nbsp; 'You should rather be thankful that
when you had been so foully ensnared by their wiles, good Osbert
brought you off with your life away from those bloody doings.&nbsp;
Yes, you may thank Heaven and Osbert, for you are the only one of
them living now.'</p>

<p>'Of whom, mother?'</p>

<p>'Of all the poor Protestants that like you were deluded by the
pack of murderers over there.&nbsp; What,'--fancying it would
exhilarate him to hear of his own escape--'you knew not that the
bloody Guise and the Paris cut-throats rose and slew every Huguenot
they could lay hands on?&nbsp; Why, did not the false wench put off
your foolish runaway project for the very purpose of getting you
into the trap on the night of the massacre?'</p>

<p>He looked with a piteous, appealing glance from her to Cecily
and Sir Marmaduke, as if in hopes that they would contradict.</p>

<p>'Too true, my lad,' said Sir Marmaduke.&nbsp; 'It is Heaven's
good mercy that Osbert carried you out alive.&nbsp; No other
Protestant left the palace alive but the King of Navarre and his
cousin, who turned renegades.'</p>

<p>'And she is left there?' he repeated.</p>

<p>'Heed her not, my dear boy,' began his mother; 'you are safe,
and must forget her ill-faith and----'</p>

<p>Berenger seemed scarcely to hear this speech--he held out his
hands as if stunned and dizzied, and only said, or rather
indicated, 'Let me lie down.'</p>

<p>His stepfather almost carried him across the room, and laid him
on his bed, where he turned away from the light and shut his eyes;
but the knot of ribbon and the pin-pricked word was still in his
hand, and his mother longed to take away the token of this false
love, as she believed it.&nbsp; The great clock struck the hour for
her to go.&nbsp; 'Leave him quiet,' said Cecily, gently; 'he can
bear no more now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will send over in the evening to let you know how he
fares.'</p>

<p>'But that he should be so set on the little bloodthirsty
baggage,' sighed Lady Thistlewood; and then going up to her son,
she poured out her explanation of being unable to stay, as her
parents were already at the Manor, with no better entertainers than
Lucy, Philip, and the children.&nbsp; She thanked him for the
gifts, which she would take to them with his love. All this passed
by him as though he heard it not, but when leaning down, she kissed
his forehead, and at the same time tried to withdraw the knot of
ribbon: his fingers closed on it with a grasp like steel, so cold
were they, yet so fast.</p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke lingered a few moments behind her, and Berenger
opening his eyes, as if to see whether solitude had been achieved,
found the kind-hearted knight gazing at him with eyes full of
tears.&nbsp; 'Berry, my lad,' he said, 'bear it like a man.&nbsp; I
know how hard it is.&nbsp; There's not a woman of them all that an
honest, plain Englishman has a chance with, when a smooth-tongued
Frenchman comes round her!&nbsp; But a man may live a true and
honest life however sore his heart may be, and God Almighty makes
it up to him if he faces it out manfully.'</p>

<p>Good Sir Marmaduke in his sympathy had utterly forgotten both
Berenger's French blood, and that he was the son of the very
smooth-tongued interloper who had robbed his life of its first
bloom.&nbsp; Berenger was altogether unequal to do more than
murmur, as he held out his hand in response to the kindness, 'You
do not know her.'</p>

<p>"Ah! Poor lad.'&nbsp; Sir Marmaduke shook his head and left him
to Cecily.</p>

<p>After the first shock, Berenger never rested till he had made
Osbert, Mr. Adderley, and Cecily tell him all they knew, and asked
by name after those whom he had known best at Paris.&nbsp; Alas! of
all those, save such as had been in the Ambassador's house, there
was but one account to give.&nbsp; Venerable warrior, noble-hearted
youth, devoted pastor, all alike had perished!</p>

<p>This frightful part of the story was altogether new to
him.&nbsp; He had been probably the earliest victim in the Louvre,
as being the special object of private malice, which had contrived
to involve him in the general catastrophe; and his own
recollections carried him only to the flitting of lights and
ringing of bells, that has made him imagine that an alarm of fire
would afford a good opportunity of escape if SHE would but
come.&nbsp; A cloaked figure had approached, --he had held out his
arms--met that deadly stroke-- heard the words hissed in his
ear.</p>

<p>He owned that for some time past strange recollections had been
flitting though his mind--a perpetual unsatisfied longing for and
expectation of his wife, and confused impressions of scenes and
people had harassed him perpetually, even when he could not discern
between dreams and reality; but knowing that he had been very ill,
he had endeavoured to account for everything as delirious fancies,
but had become increasingly distressed by their vividness,
confusion, and want of outward confirmation.&nbsp; At last these
solid tokens and pledges from that time had brought certainty back,
and with it the harmony and clearness of his memory: and the strong
affection, that even his oblivion had not extinguished, now
recurred in all its warmth to its object.</p>

<p>Four months had passed, as he now discovered, since that night
when he had hoped to have met Eustacie, and she must be believing
him dead.&nbsp; His first measure on the following day when he had
been dressed and seated in his chair was to send for his casket,
and with his slow stiff arm write thus:--</p>

<p>'Mon Coeur, My own sweetheart,--Hast thou thought me dead, and
thyself deserted?&nbsp; Osbert will tell thee all, and why I can
scarce write.&nbsp; Trust thyself to him to bring to me.&nbsp; I
shall be whole seeing thee.&nbsp; Or if thou canst not come with
him, write or send me the least token by him, and I will come and
bear thee home so soon as I can put foot in stirrup.&nbsp; Would
that I could write all that is in my heart!</p>

<p>'Thy Husband.'</p>

<p>It was all that either head or hand would enable him to say, but
he had the fullest confidence in Landry Osbert, who was one of the
few who understood him at half a word.&nbsp; He desired Osbert to
seek the lady out wherever she might be, whether still at court or
in a convent, convey the letter to her if possible, and, if she
could by any means escape, obtain from Chateau Leurre such an
escort as she could come to England with.&nbsp; If, as was too much
to be feared, she was under too close restraint, Osbert should send
intelligence home, as he could readily do through the Ambassador's
household, and Berenger trusted by that time to be able to take
measures for claiming her in person.</p>

<p>Osbert readily undertook everything, but supplies for his
journey were needed, and there was an absolute commotion in the
house when it was known that Berenger had been writing to his
faithless spouse, and wishing to send for her.&nbsp; Lord Walwyn
came up to visit his grandson, and explain to him with much pity
and consideration that he considered such a step as vain, and only
likely to lead to further insult.&nbsp; Berenger's respect forced
him to listen without interruption, and though he panted to answer,
it was a matter of much difficulty, for the old lord was becoming
deaf, and could not catch the indistinct, agitated words--</p>

<p>'My Lord, she is innocent as day.'</p>

<p>'Ah!&nbsp; Anan, boy.'</p>

<p>'I pledge my life on her love and innocence.'</p>

<p>'Love! Yes, my poor boy; but if she be unworthy?--Eh? Cecily,
what says he?'</p>

<p>'He is sure of her innocence, sir?'</p>

<p>'That is of course.&nbsp; But, my dear lad, you will soon learn
that even a gentle, good woman who has a conscience-keeper is too
apt to think her very sense of right ought to be sacrificed to what
she calls her religion.--What is it, what is he telling you,
Cecily?'</p>

<p>'She was ready to be one of us,' Berenger said, with a great
effort to make it clear.</p>

<p>'Ah, a further snare.&nbsp; Poor child!&nbsp; The very softest
of them become the worst deceivers, and the kindred who have had
the charge of her all their life could no doubt bend her will.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Berenger, finding argument impossible, 'if you will
but let me dispatch Osbert, her answer will prove to you what she
is.'</p>

<p>'There is something in that,' said Lord Walwyn, when he had
heard it repeated by Cecily.&nbsp; 'It is, of course, needful that
both she and her relations should be aware of Berenger's life, and
I trow nothing but the reply will convince him.'</p>

<p>'Convince him!' muttered Berenger.&nbsp; 'Oh that I could make
him understand.&nbsp; What a wretch I am to have no voice to defend
her!'</p>

<p>'What?' said the old lord again.</p>

<p>'Only that I could speak, sir; you should know why it is
sacrilege to doubt her.'</p>

<p>'Ah! well, we will not wound you, my son, while talk is
vain.&nbsp; You shall have the means of sending your groom, if thus
you will set your mind at rest, though I had rather have trusted to
Walsingham's dealing.&nbsp; I will myself give him a letter to Sir
Francis, to forward him on his way; and should the young lady prove
willing to hold to her contract and come to you here, I will pray
him to do everything to aid her that may be consistent with his
duty in his post.'</p>

<p>This was a great and wonderful concession for Lord Walwyn, and
Berenger was forced to be contented with it, though it galled him
terribly to have Eustacie distrusted, and be unable to make his
vindication even heard or understood, as well as to be forced to
leave her rescue, and even his own explanation to her, to a mere
servant.</p>

<p>This revival of his memory had not at all conduced to his
progress in recovery.&nbsp; His brain was in no state for
excitement or agitation, and pain and confusion were the
consequence, and were counteracted, after the practice of the time,
by profuse bleedings, which prolonged his weakness.&nbsp; The
splintered state of the jaw and roof of the moth likewise produced
effects that made him suffer severely, and deprived him at times
even of the small power of speech that he usually possessed; and
though he had set his heart upon being able to start for Paris so
soon as Osbert's answer should arrive, each little imprudence he
committed, in order to convince himself of his progress, threw him
back so seriously, that he was barely able to walk down-stairs to
the hall, and sit watching--watching, so that it was piteous to see
him--the gates of the courtyard, but the time that, on a cold March
day, a booted and spurred courier (not Osbert) entered by them.</p>

<p>He sprang up, and faster than he had yet attempted to move, met
the man in the hall, and demanded the packet.&nbsp; It was a large
one, done up in canvas, and addressed to the Right Honourable and
Worshipful Sir William, Baron Walwyn of Hurst Walwyn, and he had
further to endure the delay of carrying it to his grandfather's
library, which he entered with far less delay and ceremony than was
his wont.&nbsp; 'Sit down, Berenger,' said the old man, while
addressing himself to the fastenings; and the permission was
needed, for he could hardly have stood another minute.&nbsp; The
covering contained a letter to Lord Walwyn himself, and a packet
addressed to the Baron de Ribaumont which his trembling fingers
could scarcely succeed in cutting and tearing open.</p>

<p>How shall it be told what the contents of the packet were?&nbsp;
Lord Walwyn reading on with much concern, but little surprise, was
nevertheless startled by the fierce shout with which Berenger broke
out:</p>

<p>'A lie! A lie forged in hell!'&nbsp; And then seizing the
parchment, was about to rend it with all the force of passion, when
his grandfather, seizing his hand, said, in his calm, authoritative
voice, 'Patience, my poor son.'</p>

<p>'How, how should I have patience when they send me such poisoned
lies as these of my wife, and she is in the power of the
villains?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grandfather, I must go instantly---'</p>

<p>'Let me know what you have heard,' said Lord Walwyn, holding him
feebly indeed, but with all the impressive power and gravity of his
years.</p>

<p>'Falsehoods,' said Berenger, pushing the whole mass of papers
over to him, and then hiding his head between his arms on the
table.</p>

<p>Lord Walwyn finished his own letter first.&nbsp; Walsingham
wrote with much kind compassion, but quite decisively.&nbsp; He had
no doubt that the Ribaumont family had acted as one wheel in the
great plot that had destroyed all the heads of Protestant families
and swept away among others, as they had hoped, the only scion of
the rival house.&nbsp; The old Chevalier de Ribaumont had, he said,
begun by expressing sorrow for the mischance that had exposed his
brave young cousin to be lost in the general catastrophe, and he
had professed proportionate satisfaction on hearing of the young
man's safety.&nbsp; But the Ambassador believed him to have been
privy to his son's designs; and whether Mdlle. de Nid de Merle
herself had been a willing agent or not, she certainly had remained
in the hands of the family.&nbsp; The decree annulling the marriage
had been published, the lady was in a convent in Anjou, and
Narcisse de Ribaumont had just been permitted to assume the title
of Marquis de Nid de Merle, and was gone into Anjou to espouse her.
Sir Francis added a message of commiseration for the young Baron,
but could not help congratulating his old friend on having his
grandson safe and free from these inconvenient ties.</p>

<p>Berenger's own packet contained, in the first place, a copy of
the cassation of the marriage, on the ground of its having been
contracted when the parties were of too tender age to give their
legal consent, and its having been unsatisfied since they had
reached ecclesiastical years for lawful contraction of wedlock.</p>

<p>The second was one of the old Chevalier's polite
productions.&nbsp; He was perfectly able to ignore Berenger's
revocation of his application for the separation, since the first
letter had remained unanswered, and the King's peremptory commands
had prevented Berenger from taking any open measures after his
return from Montpipeau.&nbsp; Thus the old gentleman, after
expressing due rejoicing at his dear young cousin's recovery, and
regret at the unfortunate mischance that had led to his confounded
with the many suspected Huguenots, proceeded as if matters stood
exactly as they had been before the pall-mall party, and as if the
decree that he enclosed were obtained in accordance with the young
Baron's intentions.&nbsp; He had caused it to be duly registered,
and both parties were at liberty to enter upon other contracts of
matrimony.&nbsp; The further arrangements which Berenger had
undertaken to sell his lands in Normandy, and his claim on the
ancestral castle in Picardy, should be carried out, and deeds sent
for his signature so soon as he should be of age.&nbsp; In the
meantime, the Chevalier courteously imparted to his fair cousin the
marriage of his daughter, Mademoiselle Diane de Ribaumont with M.
le Comte de Selinville, which had taken place on the last St.
Martin's day, and of his niece, Mademoiselle Eustacie de Ribaumont
de Nid de Merle with his son, who had received permission to take
her father's title of Marquis de Nid de Merle.&nbsp; The wedding
was to take place at Bellaise before the end of the Cardinal, and
would be concluded before this letter came to hand.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was an ill written and spelt letter, running
somewhat thus--</p>

<p>'Monseigneur,--Your faithful servant hopes that Monsieur le
Baron will forgive him for not returning, since I have been assured
by good priests that it is not possible to save my soul in a
country of heretics.&nbsp; I have done everything as Monsieur
commanded, I have gone down into Anjou, and have had the honour to
see the young lady to whom Monsieur le Baron charged me with a
commission, and I delivered to her his letter, whereupon the lady
replied that she thanked M. le Baron for the honour he had done
her, but that being on the point of marriage to M. le Marquis de
Nid de Merle, she did not deem it fitting to write to him, nor had
she any tokens to send him, save what he had received on the St.
Barthelemy midnight; they might further his suit elsewhere.&nbsp;
These, Monsieur, were her words, and she laughed as she said them,
so gaily that I thought her fairer than ever.&nbsp; I have
prevailed with her to take me into her service as intendant of the
Chateau de Nid de Merle, knowing as she does my fidelity to the
name of Ribaumont.&nbsp; And so, trusting Monseigneur will pardon
me for what I do solely for the good of my soul, I will ever pray
for his welfare, and remain,</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'His faithful menial and valet,</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'LANDRY OSBERT.'</p>

<p>The result was only what Lord Walwyn had anticipated, but he was
nevertheless shocked at the crushing weight of the blow.&nbsp; His
heart was full of compassion for the youth so cruelly treated in
these his first years of life, and as much torn in his affections
as mangled in person.&nbsp; After a pause, while he gathered up the
sense of the letters, he laid his hand kindly on his grandson's
arm, and said, 'This is a woeful budget, my poor son; we will do
our best to help you to bear it.'</p>

<p>'The only way to bear it,' said Berenger, lifting up his face,
'is for me to take horse and make for Anjou instantly.&nbsp; She
will hold out bravely, and I may yet save her.'</p>

<p>'Madness,' said his grandfather; 'you have then not read your
fellow's letter?'</p>

<p>'I read no letter from fellow of mine.&nbsp; Yonder is a vile
forgery.&nbsp; Narcisse's own, most likely.&nbsp; No one else would
have so profaned her as to put such words into her mouth!&nbsp; My
dear faithful foster-brother--have they murdered him?'</p>

<p>'Can you point to any proof that it is forged?' said Lord
Walwyn, aware that handwriting was too difficult an art, and far
too crabbed, among persons of Osbert's class, for there to be any
individuality of penmanship.</p>

<p>'It is all forged,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'It is as false that
she could frame such a message as that poor Osbert would leave
me.'</p>

<p>'These priests have much power over the conscience,' began Lord
Walwyn; but Berenger, interrupting his grandfather for the first
time in his life, cried, 'No priest could change her whole
nature.&nbsp; Oh! my wife! my darling! what may they not be
inflicting on her now!&nbsp; Sir, I must go.&nbsp; She may be
saved!&nbsp; The deadly sin may be prevented!'</p>

<p>'This is mere raving, Berenger,' said Lord Walwyn, not catching
half what he said, and understanding little more than his
resolution to hasten in quest of the lady.&nbsp; 'You, who have not
mounted a horse, nor walked across the pleasance yet!'</p>

<p>'My limbs should serve me to rescue her, or they are worth
nothing to me.'</p>

<p>Lord Walwyn would have argued that he need not regret his
incapacity to move, since it was no doubt already too late, but
Berenger burst forth--'She will resist; she will resist to the
utmost, even if she deems me dead. Tortures will not shake her when
she knows I live.&nbsp; I must prepare.'&nbsp; And he started to
his feet.</p>

<p>'Grandson,' said Lord Walwyn, laying a hand on his arm, 'listen
to me.&nbsp; You are in not state to judge for yourself.&nbsp; I
therefore command you to desist from this mad purpose.'</p>

<p>He spoke gravely, but Berenger was disobedient for the first
time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'My Lord,' he said, 'you are but my grandfather.&nbsp; She is my
wife.&nbsp; My duty is to her.'</p>

<p>He had plucked his sleeve away and was gone, before Lord Walwyn
had been able to reason with him that there was no wife in the
case, a conclusion at which the old statesman would not have
arrived had he known of the ceremony at Montpipeau, and all that
had there passed; but not only did Berenger deem himself bound to
respect the King's secret, but conversation was so difficult to him
that he had told very little of his adventures, and less to Lord
Walwyn than any one else.&nbsp; In effect, his grandfather
considered this resolution of going to France as mere frenzy, and
so it almost was, not only on the score of health and danger, but
because as a ward, he was still so entirely under subjection, that
his journey could have been hindered by absolutely forcible
detention; and to this Lord Walwyn intended to resort, unless the
poor youth either came to a more rational mind, or became
absolutely unable to travel.</p>

<p>The last--as he had apprehended--came to pass only too
surely.&nbsp; The very attempt to argue and to defend Eustacie was
too much for the injured head; and long before night Berenger full
believed himself on the journey, acted over its incidents, and
struggled wildly with difficulties, all the time lying on his bed,
with the old servants holding him down, and Cecily listening
tearfully to his ravings.</p>

<p>For weeks longer he was to lie there in greater danger than
ever.&nbsp; He only seemed soothed into quiet when Cecily chanted
those old Latin hymns of her Benedictine rule, and then--when he
could speak at all--he showed himself to be in imagination praying
in Eustacie's convent chapel, sure to speak to her when the service
should be over.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.&nbsp; NOTRE-DAME DE BELLAISE*</h3>

<p>There came a man by middle day,</p>

<p>He spied his sport and went away,</p>

<p>And brought the king that very night,</p>

<p>And brake my bower and slew my knight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Border Widow's Lament</p>

<p>*[footnote: Bellaise is not meant for a type of all nunneries,
but of the condition to which many of the lesser ones had come
before the general reaction and purification of the seventeenth
century.]</p>

<p>That same Latin hymn which Cecily St. John daily chanted in her
own chamber was due from the choir of Cistercian sisters in the
chapel of the Convent of Our Lady at Bellaise, in the Bocage of
Anjou; but there was a convenient practice of lumping together the
entire night and forenoon hours at nine o'clock in the morning, and
all the evening ones at Compline, so that the sisters might have
undisturbed sleep at night and entertainment by day.&nbsp; Bellaise
was a very comfortable little nunnery, which only received richly
dowered inmates, and was therefore able to maintain them in much
ease, though without giving occasion to a breath of scandal.&nbsp;
Founded by a daughter of the first Angevin Ribaumont, it had become
a sort of appendage for the superfluous daughters of the house, and
nothing would more have amazed its present head, Eustacie Barbe de
Ribaumont,--conventually known as La Mere Marie Seraphine de
St.-Louis, and to the world as Madame de Bellaise,--than to be
accused of not fulfilling the intentions of the Bienheureuse Barbe,
the foundress, or of her patron St. Bernard.</p>

<p>Madame de Bellaise was a fine-looking woman of forty, in a high
state of preservation, owing to the healthy life she had led.&nbsp;
Her eyes were of brilliant, beautiful black her complexion had a
glow, her hair--for she wore it visibly--formed crisp rolls of
jetty ringlets on her temples, almost hiding her close white
cap.&nbsp; The heavy thick veil was tucked back beneath the furred
purple silk hood that fastened under her chin.&nbsp; The white
robes of her order were not of serge, but of the finest cloth, and
were almost hidden by a short purple cloak with sleeves, likewise
lined and edged with fur, and fastened on the bosom with a gold
brooch.&nbsp; Her fingers, bearing more rings than the signet of
her house, were concealed in embroidered gauntlets of Spanish
leather.&nbsp; One of them held an ivory-handled riding-rod, the
other the reins of the well-fed jennet, on which the lady, on a
fine afternoon, late in the Carnival, was cantering home through
the lanes of the Bocage, after a successful morning's hawking among
the wheat-ears.&nbsp; She was attended by a pair of sisters,
arrayed somewhat in the same style, and by a pair of mounted
grooms, the falconer with his charge having gone home by a
footway.</p>

<p>The sound of horses' feet approaching made her look towards a
long lane that came down at right angles to that along which she
was riding, and slacken her pace before coming to its
opening.&nbsp; And as she arrived at the intersection, she beheld
advancing, mounted on a little rough pony, the spare figure of her
brother the Chevalier, in his home suit, so greasy and frayed, that
only his plumed hat (and a rusty plume it was) and the old sword at
his side showed his high degree.</p>

<p>He waved his hand to her as a sign to halt, and rode quickly up,
scarcely giving time for a greeting ere he said, 'Sister the little
one is not out with you.'</p>

<p>'No, truly, the little mad thing, she is stricter and more
head-strong than ever was her preceptress.&nbsp; Poor
Monique!&nbsp; I had hoped that we should be at rest when that <i>
cass-tete</i> had carried off her scruples to Ste.-Claire, at
Lucon, but here is this little droll far beyond her, without being
even a nun!'</p>

<p>'Assuredly not.&nbsp; The business must be concluded at
once.&nbsp; She must be married before Lent.'</p>

<p>'That will scarce be--in her present frame.'</p>

<p>'It must be.&nbsp; Listen, sister.&nbsp; Here is this miserable
alive!'</p>

<p>'Her spouse!'</p>

<p>'Folly about her spouse!&nbsp; The decree from Rome has annulled
the foolish mummery of her infancy.&nbsp; It came a week after the
Protestant conspiracy, and was registered when the Norman peasants
at Chateau Leurre showed contumacy.&nbsp; It was well; for, behold,
our gallant is among his English friends, recovering, and even
writing a billet.&nbsp; Anon he will be upon our hands in
person.&nbsp; By the best fortune, Gillot fell in with his
messenger this morning, prowling about on his way to the convent,
and brought him to me to be examined.&nbsp; I laid him fat in ward,
and sent Gillot off to ride day and night to bring my son down to
secure the girl at once.'</p>

<p>'You will never obtain her consent.&nbsp; She is distractedly in
love with his memory!&nbsp; Let her guess at his life, and---'</p>

<p>'Precisely.&nbsp; Therefore must we be speedy.&nbsp; All Paris
knows it by this time, for the fellow went straight to the English
Ambassador; and I trust my son has been wise enough to set off
already; for should we wait till after Lent, Monsieur le Baron
himself might be upon us.'</p>

<p>'Poor child!&nbsp; You men little heed how you make a woman
suffer.'</p>

<p>'How, Reverend Mother! you pleading for a heretic marriage, that
would give our rights to a Huguenot--what say I?--an English
renegade!'</p>

<p>'I plead not, brother.&nbsp; The injustice towards you must be
repaired; but I have a certain love for my niece, and I fear she
will be heartbroken when she learns the truth, the poor child.'</p>

<p>'Bah!&nbsp; The Abbess should rejoice in thus saving her
soul!&nbsp; How if her heretic treated Bellaise like the convents
of England?'</p>

<p>'No threats, brother.&nbsp; As a daughter of Ribaumont and a
mother of the Church will I stand by you,' said the Abbess with
dignity.</p>

<p>'And now tell me how it has been with the child.&nbsp; I have
not seen her since we agreed that the request did but aggravate
her.&nbsp; You said her health was better since her nurse had been
so often with her, and that she had ceased from her
austerities.'</p>

<p>'Not entirely; for when first she came, in her transports of
despair and grief on finding Soeur Monique removed, she extorted
from Father Bonami a sort of hope that she might yet save her
husband's, I mean the Baron's soul.&nbsp; Then, truly, it was a
frenzy of fasts and prayers.&nbsp; Father Bonami has made his
profit, and so have the fathers of Chollet--all her money has gone
in masses, and in alms to purchase the prayers of the poor, and she
herself fasting on bread and water, kneeling barefooted in the
chapel till she was transfixed with cold.&nbsp; No <i>
chaufferette</i>, not she!&nbsp; Obstinate to the last
degree!&nbsp; Tell her she would die--it was the best news one
could bring; all her desire, to be in a more rigid house with Soeur
Monique at Lucon.&nbsp; At length, Mere Perrine and Veronique found
her actually fainting and powerless with cold on the chapel-floor;
and since that time she has been more reasonable.&nbsp; There are
prayers as much as ever; but the fancy to kill herself with fasting
has passed.&nbsp; She begins to recover her looks, nay, sometimes I
have thought she had an air of hope in her eyes and lips; but what
know I?&nbsp; I have much to occupy me, and she persists in
shutting herself up with her woman.'</p>

<p>'You have not allowed her any communication from without?'</p>

<p>'Mere Perrine has come and gone freely; but she is
nothing.&nbsp; No, the child could have no correspondence.&nbsp;
She did, indeed, write a letter to the Queen, as you know, brother,
six weeks ago; but that has never been answered, nor could any
letters have harmed you, since it is only now that this young man
is known to be living.'</p>

<p>'You are right, sister.&nbsp; No harm can have been done.&nbsp;
All will go well.&nbsp; The child must be wearied with her frenzy
of grief and devotion!&nbsp; She will catch gladly at an excuse for
change.&nbsp; A scene or two, and she will readily yield!'</p>

<p>'It is true,' said the Abbess, thoughtfully, 'that she has
walked and ridden out lately.&nbsp; She has asked questions about
her Chateaux, and their garrisons.&nbsp; I have heard nothing of
the stricter convent for many weeks; but still, brother, you must
go warily to work.'</p>

<p>'And you, sister, must show no relenting.&nbsp; Let her not
fancy she can work upon you.'</p>

<p>By this time the brother and sister were at the gateway of the
convent; a lay sister presided there, but there was no <i>
cloture</i>, as the strict seclusion of a nunnery was called, and
the Chevalier rode into the cloistered quadrangle as naturally as
if he had been entering a secular Chateau, dismounted at the porch
of the hall, and followed Madame de Bellaise to the parlour, while
she dispatched a request that her niece would attend her there.</p>

<p>The parlour had no grating to divide it, but was merely a large
room furnished with tapestry, carved chests, chairs, and cushions,
much like other reception-rooms. A large, cheerful wood-fire blazed
upon the hearth, and there was a certain air of preparation, as
indeed an ecclesiastical dignity from Saumur was expected to sup
with the ladies that evening.</p>

<p>After some interval, spent by the Chevalier in warming himself,
a low voice at the door was heard, saying, <i>'Deus
vobiscum</i>.'&nbsp; The Abbess answered, <i>'Et cum spiritu
tuo</i>;' and on this monastic substitute for a knock and 'come
in,' there appeared a figure draped and veiled from head to foot in
heavy black, so as to look almost like a sable moving cone.&nbsp;
She made an obeisance as she entered, saying, 'You commanded my
presence, Madame?'</p>

<p>'Your uncle would speak to you, daughter, on affairs of
moment.'</p>

<p>'At his service.&nbsp; I, too, would speak to him.'</p>

<p>'First, then, my dear friend,' said the Chevalier, 'let me see
you.&nbsp; That face must not be muffled any longer from those who
love you.'</p>

<p>She made no movement of obedience, until her aunt peremptorily
bade her turn back her veil.&nbsp; She did so, and disclosed the
little face, so well known to her uncle, but less childish in its
form, and the dark eyes sparkling, though at once softer and more
resolute.</p>

<p>'Ah! my fair niece,' said the Chevalier, 'this is no visage to
be hidden!&nbsp; I am glad to see it re-embellished, and it will be
lovelier than ever when you have cast off this disguised.'</p>

<p>'That will never be,' said Eustacie.</p>

<p>'Ah! we know better!&nbsp; My daughter is sending down a
counterpart of her own wedding-dress for your bride of the <i>
Mardi-Gras</i>.'</p>

<p>'And who may that bride be?' said Eustacie, endeavouring to
speak as though it were nothing to her.</p>

<p>'Nay, <i>ma petite</i>! it is too long to play the ignorant when
the bridegroom is on his way from Paris.'</p>

<p>'Madame,' said Eustacie, turning to her aunt, 'you cannot suffer
this scandal.&nbsp; The meanest peasant may weep her first year of
widowhood in peace.'</p>

<p>'Listen, child.&nbsp; There are weighty reasons.&nbsp; The Duke
of Anjou is a candidate for the throne of Poland, and my son is to
accompany him thither.&nbsp; He must go as Marquis de Nid de Merle,
in full possession of your estates.'</p>

<p>'Let him take them,' began Eustacie, 'who first commits a
cowardly murder, and then forces himself on the widow he has
made?'</p>

<p>'Folly, child, folly,' said the Chevalier, who supposed her
ignorant of the circumstances of her husband's assassination; and
the Abbess, who was really ignorant, exclaimed--<i>'Fid donc</i>
niece; you know not what you say.'</p>

<p>'I know, Madame--I know from an eye-witness,' said Eustacie,
firmly.&nbsp; 'I know the brutal words that embittered my husband's
death; and were there no other cause, they would render wedlock
with him who spoke them sacrilege.'&nbsp; Resolutely and steadily
did the young wife speak, looking at them with the dry fixed eye to
which tears had been denied ever since that eventful night.'</p>

<p>'Poor child,' said the Chevalier to his sister.&nbsp; 'She is
under the delusion still.&nbsp; Husband!&nbsp; There is none in the
case.'&nbsp; Then waving his hand as Eustacie's face grew crimson,
and her eyes flashed indignation, while her lips parted, 'It was
her own folly that rendered it needful to put an end to the boy's
presumption. &nbsp;Had she been less wilful and more obedient,
instead of turning the poor lad's head by playing at madame, we
could have let him return to his island fogs; but when SHE
encouraged him in contemplating the carrying her away, and
alienating her and her lands from the true faith, there was but one
remedy--to let him perish with the rest.&nbsp; My son is willing to
forgive her childish pleasure in a boy's passing homage, and has
obtained the King's sanction to an immediate marriage.'</p>

<p>'Which, to spare you, my dear,' added the aunt, 'shall take
place in our chapel.'</p>

<p>'It shall never take place anywhere,' said Eustacie, quietly,
though with a quiver in her voice; 'no priest will wed me when he
has heard me.'</p>

<p>'The dispensation will overcome all scruples,' said the Abbess.
&nbsp;'Hear me, niece.&nbsp; I am sorry for you, but it is best
that you should know at once that there is nothing in heaven or
earth to aid you in resisting your duty.'</p>

<p>Eustacie made no answer, but there was a strange half-smile on
her lip, and a light in her eye which gave her an air not so much
of entreaty as of defiance.&nbsp; She glanced from one to the
other, as if considering, but then slightly shook her head.&nbsp;
'What does she mean?' asked the Chevalier and the Abbess one of
another, as, with a dignified gesture, she moved to leave the
room.</p>

<p>'Follow her.&nbsp; Convince her that she has no hope,' said the
uncle; and the Abbess, moving faster than her wont, came up with
her at the archway whence one corridor led to the chapel, another
to her own apartments.&nbsp; Her veil was down again, but her aunt
roughly withdrew it, saying, 'Look at me, Eustacie.&nbsp; I come to
warn you that you need not look to tamper with the sisters.&nbsp;
Not one will aid you in your headstrong folly.&nbsp; If you cast
not off ere supper-time this mockery of mourning, you shall taste
of that discipline you used to sigh for.&nbsp; We have borne with
your fancy long enough-- you, who are no more a widow than I--nor
wife.'</p>

<p>'Wife and widow am I in the sight of Him who will protect me,'
said Eustacie, standing her ground.</p>

<p>'Insolent!&nbsp; Why, did I not excuse this as a childish
delusion, should I not spurn one who durst love--what say I--not a
heretic merely, but the foe of her father's house?'</p>

<p>'He!' cried Eustacie; 'what had he ever done?'</p>

<p>'He inherited the blood of the traitor Baron,' returned her
aunt.&nbsp; 'Ever have that recreant line injured us!&nbsp; My
nephew's sword avenged the wrongs of many generations.'</p>

<p>'Then,' said Eustacie, looking at her with a steady, fixed look
of inquire, 'you, Madame l'Abbesse, would have neither mercy nor
pity for the most innocent offspring of the elder line?'</p>

<p>'Girl, what folly is this to talk to me of innocence.&nbsp; That
is not the question.&nbsp; The question is--obey willingly as my
dear daughter, or compulsion must be used.'</p>

<p>'My question is answered,' said Eustacie, on her side.&nbsp; 'I
see that there is neither pity nor hope from you.'</p>

<p>And with another obeisance, she turned to ascend the
stairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Madame paced back to her brother.</p>

<p>'What,' he said; 'you have not yet dealt with her?'</p>

<p>'No, brother, I never saw a like mood.&nbsp; She seems neither
to fear nor to struggle.&nbsp; I knew she was too true a Ribaumont
for weak tears and entreaties; but, fiery little being as once she
was, I looked to see her force spend itself in passion, and that
then the victory would have been easy; but no, she ever looks as if
she had some inward resource--some security--and therefore could be
calm.&nbsp; I should deem it some Huguenot fanaticism, but she is a
very saint as to the prayers of the Church, the very torment of our
lives.'</p>

<p>'Could she escape?' exclaimed the Chevalier, who had been
considering while his sister was speaking.</p>

<p>'Impossible!&nbsp; Besides, where could she go?&nbsp; But the
gates shall be closed.&nbsp; I will warn the portress to let none
pass out without my permission.'</p>

<p>'The Chevalier took a turn up and down the room; then exclaimed,
'It was very ill-advised to let her women have access to her!&nbsp;
Let us have Veronique summoned instantly.'</p>

<p>At that moment, however, the ponderous carriage of Monseigneur,
with out-riders, both lay and clerical, came trampling up to the
archway, and the Abbess hurried off to her own apartment to divest
herself of her hunting-gear ere she received her guest; and the
orders to one of the nuns to keep a watch on her niece were oddly
mixed with those to the cook, confectioner, and butterer.</p>

<p>La Mere Marie Seraphine was not a cruel or an unkind
woman.&nbsp; She had been very fond of her pretty little niece in
her childhood, but had deeply resented the arrangement which had
removed her from her own superintendence to that of the
Englishwoman, besides the uniting to the young Baron one whom she
deemed the absolute right of Narcisse.&nbsp; She had received
Eustacie on her first return with great joy, and had always treated
her with much indulgence, and when the drooping, broken-hearted
girl came back once more to the shelter of her convent, the
good-humoured Abbess only wished to make her happy again.</p>

<p>But Eustacie's misery was far beyond the ken of her aunt, and
the jovial turn of these consolations did but deepen her
agony.&nbsp; To be congratulated on her release from the heretic,
assured of future happiness with her cousin, and, above all, to
hear Berenger abused with all the bitterness of rival family and
rival religion, tore up the lacerated spirit.&nbsp; Ill, dejected,
and broken down, too subdued to fire up in defence, and only
longing for the power of indulging in silent grief, Eustacie had
shrunk from her, and wrapped herself up in the ceaseless round of
masses and prayers, in which she was allowed to perceive a
glimmering of hope for her husband's soul.&nbsp; The Abbess, ever
busy with affairs of her convent or matters of pleasure, soon
relinquished the vain attempt to console where she could not
sympathize, trusted that the fever of devotion would wear itself
out, and left her niece to herself.&nbsp; Of the seven nuns, two
were decorously gay, like their Mother Abbess; one was a prodigious
worker of tapestry, two were unrivalled save by one another as
confectioners.&nbsp; Eustacie had been their pet in her younger
days; now she was out of their reach, they tried in turn to comfort
her; and when she would not be comforted, they, too, felt aggrieved
by the presence of one whose austerity reproached their own laxity;
they resented her disappointment at Soeur Monique's having been
transferred to Lucon, and they, too, left her to the only persons
whose presence she had ever seemed to relish,--namely, her maid
Veronique, and Veronique's mother, her old nurse Perrine, wife of a
farmer about two miles off.&nbsp; The woman had been Eustacie's
foster-mother, and continued to exert over her much of the
caressing care of a nurse.</p>

<p>After parting with her aunt, Eustacie for a moment looked
towards the chapel, then, clasping her hands, murmured to herself,
'No! no!&nbsp; speed is my best hope;' and at once mounted the
stairs, and entered a room, where the large stone crucifix, a waxen
Madonna, and the holy water font gave a cell-like aspect to the
room; and a straw pallet covered with sackcloth was on the floor, a
richly curtained couch driven into the rear, as unused.</p>

<p>She knelt for a moment before the Madonna; 'Ave Maria, be with
me and mine.&nbsp; Oh! blessed Lady, thou hadst to fly with thy
Holy One from cruel men.&nbsp; Have thou pity on the
fatherless!'</p>

<p>Then going to the door, she clapped her hands; and, as Veronique
entered, she bade her shut and bolt the door, and at the same
moment began in nervous haste to throw off her veil and unfasten
her dress.</p>

<p>'Make haste, Veronique.&nbsp; A dress of thine---'</p>

<p>'All is known, then!' cried Veronique, throwing up her arms.</p>

<p>'No, but he is coming--Narcisse--to marry me at
once--<i>Marde-Gras</i>---'</p>

<p><i>'Et quoi</i>?&nbsp; Madame has but to speak the word, and it
is impossible.'</p>

<p>'And after what my aunt has said, I would die a thousand deaths
ere speaking that word.&nbsp; I asked her, Veronique!&nbsp; She
would have vengeance on the most guiltless--the most guiltless--do
you hear?-- of the Norman house.&nbsp; Never, never shall she have
the chance!&nbsp; Come, thy striped petticoat!'</p>

<p>'But, oh! what will Madame do?&nbsp; Where would she go?&nbsp;
Oh! it is impossible.'</p>

<p>'First to thy father's.&nbsp; Yes, I know.&nbsp; He has once
called it a madness to think of rallying my vassals to protect
their lady.&nbsp; That was when he heard of it from thee--thou
faint of heart--and thy mother.&nbsp; I shall speak to him in
person now.&nbsp; Make haste, I tell thee, girl.&nbsp; I must be
out of this place before I am watched or guarded,' she added
breathlessly.&nbsp; 'I feel as if each moment I lost might have
death upon it;' and she looked about her like a startled deer.</p>

<p>'To my father's.&nbsp; Ah! there it is not so ill!&nbsp; But the
twilights, the length of way,' sobbed Veronique, in grievous
distress and perplexity.&nbsp; 'Oh! Madame, I cannot see you
go.&nbsp; The Mother Abbess is good.&nbsp; She must have
pity.&nbsp; Oh, trust to her!'</p>

<p>'Trust!&nbsp; Did I not trust to my cousin Diane?&nbsp;
Never!&nbsp; Nothing will kill me but remaining in their
hands.'</p>

<p>Veronique argued and implored in vain.&nbsp; Ever since, in the
height of those vehement austerities by which the bereaved and
shattered sufferer strove to appease her wretchedness by the utmost
endeavour to save her husband's soul, the old foster-mother had
made known to her that she might thus sacrifice another than
herself.&nbsp; Eustacie's elastic heart had begun to revive, with
all its dauntless strength of will.&nbsp; What to her women seemed
only a fear, was to her only a hope.</p>

<p>Frank and confiding as was her nature, however, the cruel
deceptions already practiced on her by her own kindred, together
with the harsh words with which the Abbess spoke of Berenger, had
made her aware that no comfort must be looked for in that
quarter.&nbsp; It was, after all, perhaps her won instinct, and the
aunt's want of sympathy, that withheld her from seeking counsel of
any save Perrine and her daughter, at any rate till she could
communicate with the kind young Queen.&nbsp; To her, then, Eustacie
had written, entreating that a royal mandate would recall her in
time to bestow herself in some trustworthy hands, or even in her
husband's won Norman castle, where his heir would be both safe and
welcome.&nbsp; But time has passed--the whole space that she had
reckoned as needful for the going and coming of her
messenger--allowing for all the obstructions of winter roads--nay,
he had come back; she knew letter was delivered, but answer there
was none.&nbsp; It might yet come--perhaps a royal carriage and
escort--and day after day had she waited and hoped, only tardily
admitting the conviction that Elisabeth of Austria was as powerless
as Eustacie de Ribaumont, and meantime revolving and proposing many
a scheme that could only have entered the brain of a brave-spirited
child as she was.&nbsp; To appeal to her vassals, garrison with
them a ruinous old tower in the woods, and thence send for aid to
the Montmorencys; to ride to Saumur, and claim the protection of
the governor of the province; to make her way to the coast and sail
for England; to start for Paris, and throw herself in person on the
Queen's protection,--all had occurred to her, and been discussed
with her two <i>confidantes</i>; but the hope of the Queen's
interference, together with the exceeding difficulty of acting, had
hitherto prevented her from taking any steps, since no suspicion
had arisen in the minds of those about her.&nbsp; Veronique, caring
infinitely more for her mistress's health and well-being than for
the object of Eustacie's anxieties, had always secretly trusted
that delay would last till action was impossible, and that the
discovery would be made, only without her being accused of
treason.&nbsp; In the present stress of danger, she could but
lament and entreat, for Eustacie's resolution bore her down; and
besides, as she said to herself, her Lady was after all going to
her foster-father and mother, who would make her hear reason, and
bring her back at once, and then there would be no anger nor
disgrace incurred.&nbsp; The dark muddy length of walk would be the
worst of it--and, bah! most likely Madame would be convinced by it,
and return of her own accord.</p>

<p>So Veronique, though not intermitting her protests, adjusted her
own dress upon her mistress,--short striped petticoat, black
bodice, winged turban-like white cap, and a great muffling gray
cloth cloak and hook over the head and shoulders--the costume in
which Veronique was wont to run to her home in the twilight on
various errands, chiefly to carry her mistress's linen; for
starching Eustacie's plain bands and cuffs was Mere Perrine's
special pride.&nbsp; The wonted bundle, therefore, now contained a
few garments, and the money and jewels, especially the chaplet of
pearls, which Eustacie regarded as a trust.</p>

<p>Sobbing, and still protesting, Veronique, however, engaged that
if her Lady succeeded in safely crossing the kitchen in the
twilight, and in leaving the convent, she would keep the secret of
her escape as long as possible, reporting her refusal to appear at
supper, and making such excuses as might very probably prevent the
discovery of her flight till next day.</p>

<p>'And then,' said Eustacie, 'I will send for thee, either to
Saumur or to the old tower!&nbsp; Adieu, dear Veronique, do not be
frightened.&nbsp; Thou dost not know how glad I am that the time
for doing something is come!&nbsp; To-morrow!'</p>

<p>'To-morrow!' thought Veronique, as she shut the door; 'before
that you will be back here again, my poor little Lady, trembling,
weeping, in dire need of being comforted.&nbsp; But I will make up
a good fire, and shake out the bed.&nbsp; I'll let her have no more
of that villainous palliasse.&nbsp; No, no, let her try her own
way, and repent of it; then, when this matter is over, she will
turn her mind to Chevalier Narcisse, and there will be no more
languishing in this miserable hole.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.&nbsp; THE HEARTHS AND THICKETS OF THE BOCAGE.</h3>

<p>I winna spare for his tender age,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet for his hie kin;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon as ever he born is,</p>

<p>He shall mount the gallow's pin. --Fause Foodrage.</p>

<p>Dusk was closing in, but lamps had not yet been lighted, when
with a trembling, yet almost a bounding heart, Eustacie stole down
the stone staircase, leading to a back-door--an utterly uncanonical
appendage to a nunnery, but one much used among the domestic
establishment of Bellaise.</p>

<p>A gleam of red light spread across the passage from the
half-open kitchen door, whence issued the savoury steam of the
supper preparing for Monseigneur.&nbsp; Eustacie had just
cautiously traversed it, when the voice of the presiding lay-sister
called out, 'Veronique, is that you?'</p>

<p>'Sister!' returned Eustacie, with as much of the Angevin twang
as she could assume.</p>

<p>'Where are you going?'</p>

<p>'To the Orchard Farm with this linen.'</p>

<p>'Ah! it must be.&nbsp; But there are strict orders come from
Madame about nobody going out unreported, and you may chance to
find the door locked if you do not come back in good time.&nbsp;
Oh! and I had well-night forgot;&nbsp; tell your mother to be here
early to-morrow, Madame would speak with her.'</p>

<p>Eustacie assented, half stifled by the great throb of her
fluttering heart at the sense that she had indeed seized the last
moment.&nbsp; Forth then she stepped.&nbsp; How dark, waste, and
lonely the open field looked!&nbsp; But her heart did not fail her;
she could only feel that a captivity was over, and the most vague
and terrible of her anxieties soothed, as she made her way into one
of the long shady lanes of the Bocage.&nbsp; It was nearly dark,
and very muddy, but she had all the familiarity of a native with
the way, and the farm, where she had trotted about in her infancy
like a peasant's child, always seemed like home to her.&nbsp; It
had been a prime treat to visit it during her time of education at
the convent, and there was an association of pleasure in treading
the path that seemed to bear her up, and give her enjoyment in the
mere adventure and feeling of escape and liberty.&nbsp; She had no
fear of the dark, nor of the distant barking of dogs, but the mire
was deep, and it was plodding work in those heavy <i>sabots</i>, up
the lane that led from the convent; and the poor child was sorely
weary long before she came to the top of the low hill that she used
scarcely to know to be rising round at all.&nbsp; The stars had
come out; and as she sat for a few moments to rest on a large
stone, she saw the lights of the cottage fires in the village
below, and looking round could also see the many gleams in the
convent windows, the read fire-light in her own room among
them.&nbsp; She shivered a little as she thought of its glowing
comfort, but turned her back resolutely, tightened her cloak over
her head, looked up to a glimmer in the watch-tower of her own
castle far above her on the hill and closed against her; and then
smiled to herself with hope at the sparkle of a window in a lonely
farmhouse among the fields.</p>

<p>With fresh vigour she rose, and found her way through lane and
field-path to the paddock where she had so often played.&nbsp; Here
a couple of huge dogs dashed forward with an explosion of barks,
dying away into low growls as she spoke to them by their names, and
called aloud on 'Blaise!' and 'Mere Perrine!'&nbsp; The cottage
door was opened, the light streamed forth, and a man's head in a
broad had appeared.&nbsp; 'Veronique, girl, is this an hour to be
gadding abroad?'</p>

<p>'Blaise, do you not know me?'</p>

<p>"It is our Lady.&nbsp; Ah!'</p>

<p>The next moment the wanderer was seated in the ample wooden
chair of the head of the family, the farmer and his two stout sons
standing before her as their liege Lady, and Mere Perrine hanging
over her, in great anxiety, not wholly dispelled by her low girlish
laugh, partly of exultation at her successful evasion, partly of
amusement at their wonder, and partly, too, because it was so
natural to her to enjoy herself at that hearth that she could not
help it.&nbsp; A savoury mess from the great caldron that was for
ever stewing over the fire was at once fished out for her, before
she was allowed to explain herself; and as she ate with the carved
spoon and from the earthenware crock that had been called
Mademoiselle's ever since her baby-days, Perrine chafed and warmed
her feet, fondled her, and assured her, as if she were still their
spoiled child, that they would do all she wished.</p>

<p>Pierre and Tiennot, the two sons, were sent out to fodder the
cattle, and keep careful watch for any sounds of pursuers from the
convent; and Blaise, in the plenitude of his respects and
deference, would have followed them, but Eustacie desired him to
remain to give her counsel.</p>

<p>Her first inquire was after the watch-tower.&nbsp; She did not
care for any discomfort if her vassals would be faithful, and hold
it out for her, till she could send for help to the allies of her
husband's house, and her eyes glanced as she spoke.</p>

<p>But Blaise shook his head.&nbsp; He had looked at the tower as
Madame bade, but it was all in ruins, crumbling away, and,
moreover, M. le Chevalier had put a forester there--a grim, bad
subject, who had been in the Italian wars, and cared neither for
saint nor devil, except Chevalier Narcisse.&nbsp; Indeed, even if
he had not been there, the place was untenable, it would only be
getting into a trap.</p>

<p>'Count Hebert held it out for twelve days against the English!'
said Eustacie, proudly.</p>

<p>'Ah! ah! but there were none of your falconets, or what call you
those cannons then.&nbsp; No; if Madame would present herself as a
choice morsel for Monsieur le Chevalier to snap up, that is the
place.'</p>

<p>Then came the other plan of getting an escort of the peasants
together, and riding with them towards the Huguenot territories
around La Rochelle, where, for her husband's sake, Eustacie could
hardly fail to obtain friends.&nbsp; It was the more practicable
expedient, but Blaise groaned over it, wondered how many of the
farmers could be trusted, or brought together, and finally
expressed his intention of going to consult Martin, his staunch
friend, at the next farm.&nbsp; Meantime, Madame had better lie
down and sleep.&nbsp; And Madame did sleep, in Perrine's huge
box-bedstead, with a sweet, calm, childlike slumber, whilst her
nurse sat watching her with eyes full of tears of pity and
distress; the poor young thing's buoyant hopefulness and absence of
all fear seemed to the old woman especially sad, and like a sort of
want of comprehension of the full peril in which she stood.</p>

<p>Not till near dawn was Eustacie startled from her rest by
approaching steps.&nbsp; 'Nurse, is all ready?' she cried.&nbsp;
'Can we set off?&nbsp; Are the horses there?'</p>

<p>'No, my child; it is but my good man and Martin who would speak
with you.&nbsp; Do not hasten.&nbsp; There is nothing amiss as
yet.'</p>

<p>'Oh, nurse,' cried Eustacie, as she quickly arranged the dress
in which she had lain down, 'the dear old farm always makes me
sleep well.&nbsp; This is the first time I have had no dream of the
whirling wheel and fiery gates!&nbsp; Oh, is it a token that HE is
indeed at rest?&nbsp; I am so well, so strong.&nbsp; I can ride
anywhere now.&nbsp; Let them come in and tell me.'</p>

<p>Martin was a younger, brisker, cleverer man than Blaise, and
besides being a vassal of the young Lady, was a sort of agent to
whom the Abbess instructed many of the matters of husbandry
regarding the convent lands.&nbsp; He stood, like Blaise,
bareheaded as he talked to little Lady, and heard her somewhat
peremptorily demand why they had not brought the horses and men for
her escort.</p>

<p>It was impossible that night, explained Martin.&nbsp; Time was
needed to bring in the farm-horses, and summon the other peasants,
without whom the roads were unsafe in these times of
disorder.&nbsp; He and Blaise must go round and warn them to be
ready.&nbsp; A man could not be ready in a wink of the eye, as
Madame seemed to think, and the two peasants looked impenetrable in
stolidity.</p>

<p>'Laggards that you are!' cried Eustacie, petulantly, clasping
her hands; 'and meantime all will be lost.&nbsp; They will be upon
me!'</p>

<p>'Not so, Madame.&nbsp; It is therefore that I came here,' said
Martin, deferentially, to the little fuming impatient creature;
'Madame will be far safer close at hand while the pursuit and
search are going on.&nbsp; But she must not stay here.&nbsp; This
farm is the first place they will come to, while they will never
suspect mine, and my good woman Lucette will be proud to keep watch
for her.&nbsp; Madame knows that the place is full of shrubs and
thickets, where one half of an army might spend a fine day in
looking for the other.'</p>

<p>'And at night you will get together the men and convoy me?'
asked Eustacie, eagerly.</p>

<p>'All in good time, Madame.&nbsp; Now she must be off, ere the
holy mothers be astir.&nbsp; I have brought an ass for her to
ride.'</p>

<p>Eustacie had no choice but compliance.&nbsp; None of the Orchard
family could go with her, as it was needful that they should stay
at home and appear as unconcerned as possible; but they promised to
meet her at the hour and place to be appointed, ad if possible to
bring Veronique.</p>

<p>Eating a piece of rye-bread as she went, Eustacie, in her gray
cloak, rode under Martin's guardianship along the deep lanes, just
budding with spring, in the chill dewiness before sunrise.&nbsp;
She was silent, and just a little sullen, for she had found stout
shrewd Martin less easy to talk over than the admiring Blaise, and
her spirit was excessively chafed by the tardiness of her
retainers.&nbsp; But the sun rose and cleared away all clouds of
temper, the cocks crew, the sheep bleated, and fresh morning sounds
met her ear, and seemed to cheer and fill her with hope; and in
some compunction for her want of graciousness, she thanked Martin,
and praised his ass with a pretty cordiality that would have fully
compensated for her displeasure, even if the honest man had been
sensible of it.</p>

<p>He halted under the lee of a barn, and gave a low whistle.&nbsp;
At the sound, Lucette, a brown, sturdy young woman with a red
handkerchief over her head, and another over her shoulders, came
running round the corner of the barn, and whispered eagerly under
her breath, 'Ah! Madame, Madame, what an honour!' kissing
Eustacie's hand with all her might as she spoke; 'but, alas! I fear
Madame cannot come into the house.&nbsp; The questing Brother
Francois--plague upon him!-- has taken it into his head to drop in
to breakfast.&nbsp; I longed to give him the cold shoulder, but it
might have brought suspicion down.'</p>

<p>'Right, good woman,' said Martin; 'but what shall Madame
do?&nbsp; It is broad way, and no longer safe to run the
lanes!'</p>

<p>'Give me a distaff,' said Eustacie, rising to the occasion; 'I
will go to that bushy field, and herd the cows.'</p>

<p>Madame was right, the husband and wife unwillingly agreed.&nbsp;
There, in her peasant dress, in the remote field, sloping up into a
thick wood, she was unlikely to attract attention; and though the
field was bordered on one side by the lane leading to the road to
Paris, it was separated from it by a steep bank, crowned by one of
the thick hedgerows characteristic of the Bocage.</p>

<p>Here, then, they were forced to leave her, seated on a stone
beneath a thorn-bush, distaff in hand, with bread, cheese, and a
pitcher of milk for her provisions, and three or four cows grazing
before her.&nbsp; From the higher ground below the wood of ash and
hazel, she could see the undulating fields and orchards, a few
houses, and that inhospitable castle of her own.</p>

<p>She had spent many a drearier day in the convent than this, in
the free sun and air, with the feeling of liberty, and unbounded
hopes founded on this first success.&nbsp; She told her beads
diligently, trusting that the tale of devotions for her husband's
spirit would be equally made up in the field as in the church, and
intently all day were her ears and eyes on the alert.&nbsp; Once
Lucette visited her, to bring her a basin of porridge, and to tell
her that all the world at the convent was in confusion, that
messengers had been sent out in all directions, and that M. le
Chevalier had ridden out himself in pursuit; but they should soon
hear all about it, for Martin was pretending to be amongst the
busiest, and he would know how to turn them away.&nbsp; Again, much
later in the day, Martin came striding across the field, and had
just reached her, as she sat in the hedgerow, when the great dog
who followed him pricked his ears, and a tramping and jingling was
audible in the distance in the lane.&nbsp; Eustacie held up her
finger, her eyes dilating.</p>

<p>'It must be M. le Chevalier returning.&nbsp; Madame must wait a
little longer.&nbsp; I must be at home, or they may send out to
seek me here, and that would be ruin.&nbsp; I will return as soon
as it is safe, if Madame will hide herself in the hedgerow.'</p>

<p>Into the hedgerow accordingly crept Eustacie, cowering close to
a holly-tree at the very summit of the bank, and led by a strange
fascination to choose a spot where, unseen herself, she could gaze
down on the party who came clanking along the hollow road
beneath.&nbsp; Nearer, nearer, they came; and she shuddered with
more of passion than of fear, as she beheld, not only her uncle in
his best well-preserved green suit, but Narcisse, muddy with
riding, though in his court braveries.&nbsp; Suddenly they came to
a halt close beneath her!&nbsp; Was she detected?&nbsp; Ah! just
below was the spot where the road&nbsp; to the convent parted from
the road to the farm; and, as Martin had apprehended, they were
stopping for him.&nbsp; The Chevalier ordered one of the armed men
behind him to ride up to the farm and summon Martin to speak with
him; and then he and his son, while waiting under the holly-bush,
continued their conversation.</p>

<p>'So that is the state of things!&nbsp; A fine overthrow!' quoth
Narcisse.</p>

<p>'Bah! not at all.&nbsp; She will soon be in our hands
again.&nbsp; I have spoken with, or written to, every governor of
the cities she must pass through, and not one will abet the little
runaway.&nbsp; At the first barrier she is ours.'</p>

<p><i>'Et puis</i>?'</p>

<p>'Oh, we shall have her mild as a sheep.'&nbsp; (Eustacie set her
teeth.) 'Every one will be in the same story, that her marriage was
a nullity; she cannot choose but believe, and can only be thankful
that we overlook the escapade and rehabilitate her.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, my good uncle,' almost uttered his unseen
auditor.</p>

<p>'Well!&nbsp; There is too much land down here to throw away; but
the affair has become horribly complicated and distasteful.'</p>

<p>'No such thing.&nbsp; All the easier.&nbsp; She can no longer
play the spotless saint--get weak-minded priests on her side--be
all for strict convents.&nbsp; No, no; her time for that is
past!&nbsp; Shut her up with trustworthy persons from whom she will
hear nothing from without, and she will understand her case.&nbsp;
The child?&nbsp; It will scarce be born alive, or at any rate she
need not know whether it is.&nbsp; Then, with no resource, no hope,
what can she do but be too thankful for pardon, and as glad to
conceal the past as we could wish?'</p>

<p>Eustacie clenched her fist.&nbsp; Had a pistol been within her
reach, the speaker's tenure of life had been short!&nbsp; She was
no chastened, self-restrained, forgiving saint, the poor little
thing, only a hot-tempered, generous, keenly-sensitive being,
well-nigh a child in years and in impulses, though with the
instincts of a mother awakening within her, and of a mother who
heard the life of her unborn babe plotted against.&nbsp; She was
absolutely forced to hold her lips together, to repress the sobbing
scream of fury that came to her throat; and the struggles with her
gasping breath, the surging of the blood in her ears, hindered her
from hearing or seeing anything for some seconds, though she kept
her station.&nbsp; By the time her perceptions had cleared
themselves, Martin, cap in hand, was in the lane below, listening
deferentially to the two gentlemen, who were assuring him that
inquiry had been made, and a guard carefully set at the fugitive
could have passed those, or be able to do so.&nbsp; She must
certainly be hidden somewhere near home, and Martin had better warn
all his friends against hiding her, unless they wished to be hung
up on the thresholds of their burning farmsteads.&nbsp; Martin
bowed, and thought the fellows would know their own interest and
Mademoiselle's better.</p>

<p>'Well,' said the Chevalier, 'we must begin without loss of
time.&nbsp; My son has brought down a set of fellows here, who are
trained to ferret out heretics.&nbsp; Not a runaway weasel cold
escape them!&nbsp; We will set them on as soon as ever they have
taken a bit of supper up there at the Chateau; and do you come up
with us just to show them the way across to Leonard's.&nbsp; That's
no unlikely place for her to lurk in, as you said this morning,
good fellow.'</p>

<p>It was the most remote farm from that of Martin, and Eustacie
felt how great were his services, even while she flushed with anger
to hear him speaking of her as Mademoiselle.&nbsp; He was promising
to follow immediately to the castle, to meet <i>ces Messieurs</i>
there almost as soon as they could arrive, but excusing himself
from accompanying them, by the need of driving home the big bull,
whom no one else could manage.</p>

<p>They consented, and rode on.&nbsp; Martin watched them out of
sight, then sprang up by some stepping-stones in the bank, a little
below where Eustacie sat, and came crackling through the boughs to
where she was crouching down, with fierce glittering eyes and
panting breath, like a wild animal ready to spring.</p>

<p>'Madame has heard,' said Martin, under his breath.</p>

<p>'If I have heard!&nbsp; Oh that I were a man, to slay them where
they stood!&nbsp; Martin, Martin! you will not betray me.&nbsp;
Some day WE will reward you.'</p>

<p>'Madame need not have said THAT to me,' said Martin, rather
hurt.&nbsp; 'I am only thinking what she can do.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp;
I fear that she must remain in this covert till it is dark, for
these men's eyes are all on the alert.&nbsp; At dark, I or Lucette
will come and find a shelter for her for the night.'</p>

<p>Long, long, then, did Eustacie sit, muffled in her gray cloak,
shrinking together to shelter herself from the sunset chill of
early spring, but shuddering more with horror than with cold as the
cruel cold-blooded words she had heard recurred to her, and feeling
as if she were fast within a net, every outlet guarded against her,
and search everywhere; yet still with the indomitable determination
to dare and suffer to the utmost ere that which was dearer than her
own life should come into peril from her enemies.</p>

<p>The twilight closed in, the stars came out, sounds of life died
away, and still she sat on, becoming almost torpid in the cold
darkness, until at length she heard the low call of Lucette,
'MADAME!&nbsp; AH! <i>la pauvre Madame</i>.'&nbsp; She started up,
so stiff that she could hardly more, and only guided by the voice
to feel her way through the hedgerow in the right direction.&nbsp;
Another moment, and Lucette's warn arms had received her; and she
was guided, scarce knowing how or where, in cautious silence to the
farmyard, and into the house, where a most welcome sight, a huge
fire, blazed cheerfully on the hearth, and Martin himself held open
the door for her.&nbsp; The other occupants of the kitchen were the
sleeping child in its wooden cradle, some cocks and hens upon the
rafters, and a big sheep-dog before the fire.</p>

<p>The warmth, and the chicken that Lucette had killed and dressed,
brought the colour back to the exhausted wanderer's cheek, and
enabled her again to hold council for her safety. &nbsp;It was
plain, as Martin had found in conversation with the men-at-arms,
that precautions had been taken against her escaping in any of the
directions where she might hope to have reached friends.&nbsp;
Alone she could not go, and any escort sufficient to protect her
would assuredly be stopped at the first town; besides which,
collecting it in secret was impossible under present circumstances,
and it would be sure to be at once overtaken and demolished by the
Chevalier Narcisse's well-armed followers.&nbsp; Martin, therefore,
saw no alternative but for her to lurk about in such hiding-places
as her faithful vassals could afford her, until the search should
blow over, and the vigilance of her uncle and cousin relax.&nbsp;
Hope, the high-spirited hope of early youth, looked beyond to
indefinite but infinite possibility.&nbsp; Anything was better than
the shame and horror of yielding, and Eustacie trusted herself with
all her heart for the present, fancying, she knew not what, the
future.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Vendean fidelity has often been tested, and she made
full proof of it among the lanes, copses, and homesteads of her own
broad lands.&nbsp; The whole country was a network of deep lanes,
sunk between impenetrable hedgerows, inclosing small fields,
orchards, and thickets, and gently undulating in low hills and
shallow valleys, interspersed with tall wasp-waisted windmills
airily waving their arms on the top of lofty masts.&nbsp; It was
partitioned into small farms, inhabited by a simple-hearted
peasantry, religious and diligent, with a fair amount of rural
wealth and comfort.&nbsp; Their love for their lords was loyally
warm, and Eustacie monopolized it, from their detestation of her
uncle's exactions; they would risk any of the savage punishments
with which they were threatened for concealing her; and as one by
one it was needful to take them into the secret, so as to disarm
suspicion, and she was passed from one farm to another, each proved
his faithful attachment, and though himself repaid by her thankful
smile and confiding manner.</p>

<p>The Chevalier and his son searched vigorously.&nbsp; On the
slightest suspicion, they came down to the farm, closed up the
outlets, threatened the owners, turned out the house, and the very
place they had last searched would become her quarters on the next
night!&nbsp; Messages always had warned her in time.&nbsp;
Intelligence was obtained by Martin, who contrived to remain a
confidential agent, and warnings were dispatched to her by many a
strange messenger--by little children, by old women, or even by the
village innocent.</p>

<p>The most alarming days were those when she was not the avowed
object of the chase, but when the pursuit of game rendered the
coverts in the woods and fields unsafe, and the hounds might lead
to her discovery.&nbsp; On one of these occasions Martin locked her
up in the great hayloft of the convent, where she could actually
hear the chants in the chapel, and distinguish the chatter of the
lay-sisters in the yard.&nbsp; Another time, in conjunction with
the sacristan, he bestowed her in the great seigneurial tribune (or
squire's pew) in the village church, a tall carved box, where she
was completely hidden; and the only time when she had failed to
obtain warning beforehand, she stood kneading bread at a tub in
Martin's cottage, while the hunt passed by, and a man-at-arms
looked in and questioned the master on the last traces of the
runaway.</p>

<p>It was seldom possible to see Mere Perrine, who was carefully
watched, under the conviction that she must know where her nursling
was; but one evening Veronique ventured up to Martin's farm,
trusting to tidings that the gentlemen had been Eustacie's only
secure harbour; and when, in a bright evening gleam of the setting
sun from beneath the clouds, Veronique came in sight of her Lady,
the Queen's favourite, it was to see her leading by a string a
little shaggy cow, with a bell round its neck, her gray cloak
huddled round her, though dank with wet, a long lock of black hair
streaming over her brow, her garments clinging with damp, her bare
ankles scratched with thorns, her heavy SABOTS covered with mire,
her cheeks pale with cold and wet.</p>

<p>The contrast overwhelmed poor Veronique.&nbsp; She dropped on
her knees, sobbing as if her heart would break, and declaring that
this was what the Abbess had feared; her Lady was fast killing
herself.</p>

<p>'Hush!&nbsp; Veronique,' said Eustacie; 'that is all
folly.&nbsp; I am wet and weary now, but oh! if you knew how much
sweeter to me life is now than it was, shut up down there, with my
fears.&nbsp; See,' and she held up a bunch of purple pasque-flowers
and wood-sorrel, 'this is what I found in the wood, growing out of
a rugged old dead root; and just by, sheltered by the threefold
leaves of the alleluia-flower, was a bird's nest, the mother-bird
on her eggs, watching me with the wise black eye that saw I would
not hurt her.&nbsp; And it brought back the words I had heard long
ago, of the good God caring for the sparrows; and I knew He would
care the more for me and mine, because I have not where to lay my
head.'</p>

<p>'Alas!' sobbed Veronique, 'now she is getting to be a saint
outright.&nbsp; She will be sure to die!&nbsp; Ah, Madame--dear
Madame! do but listen to me.&nbsp; If you did but know how Madame
de Bellaise is afflicting herself on your account!&nbsp; She sent
for me--ah! do not be angry, dear Lady?'</p>

<p>'I wish to hear nothing about her,' said Eustacie.</p>

<p>'Nay, listen, <i>de grace</i>--one moment, Madame!&nbsp; She has
wept, she has feared for you, all the lay-sisters say so.&nbsp; She
takes no pleasure in hawking, nor in visiting; and she did not eat
more than six of Soeur Bernardino's best conserves.&nbsp; She does
nothing but watch for tidings of Madame.&nbsp; And she sent for me,
as I told you, and conjured me, if I knew where you were, or had
any means of finding out, to implore you to trust to her.&nbsp; She
will swear on all the relics in the chapel never to give a hint to
Messieurs les Chevaliers if only you would trust her, and not slay
yourself with all this dreadful wandering.'</p>

<p>'Never!' said Eustacie; 'she said too much!'</p>

<p>'Ah! but she declares that, had she known the truth, she never
would have said that.&nbsp; Ah, yes, Madame, the Abbess is
good!'&nbsp; And Veronique, holding her mistress's cloak to secure
a hearing, detailed the Abbess' plan for lodging her niece in
secret apartments within the thickness of the convent walls, where
Mere Perrine could be with her, and every sacred pledge should be
given that could remove her fears.</p>

<p>'And could they make me believe them, so that the doubt and
dread would not kill me in themselves?' said Eustacie.</p>

<p>'But it is death--certain death, as it is.&nbsp; Oh, if Madame
would hear reason!--but she is headstrong!&nbsp; She will grieve
when it is too late!'</p>

<p>'Listen, Veronique.&nbsp; I have a far better plan.&nbsp; The
sacristan has a sister who weaves red handkerchiefs at
Chollet.&nbsp; She will receive me, and keep me as long as there is
need.&nbsp; Martin is to take me in his cart when he carries the
hay to the garrison.&nbsp; I shall be well hidden, and within reach
of your mother.&nbsp; And then, when my son is once come--then all
will be well!&nbsp; The peasants will rise in behalf of their young
Lord, though not for a poor helpless woman.&nbsp; No one will dare
to dispute his claim, when I have appealed to the King; and then,
Veronique, you shall come back to me, and all will be well!'</p>

<p>Veronique only began to wail aloud at her mistress'
obstinacy.&nbsp; Martin came up, and rudely silenced her, and said
afterwards to his wife, 'Have a care!&nbsp; That girl has--I verily
believe--betrayed her Lady once; and if she do not do so again,
from pure pity and faintness of heart, I shall be much
surprised.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.&nbsp; THE GHOSTS OF THE TEMPLARS</h3>

<p>'Tis said, as through the aisles they passed,</p>

<p>They heard strange voices on the blast,</p>

<p>And through the cloister galleries small,</p>

<p>Which at mid-height thread the chancel wall,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Loud sobs and laughter louder ran,</p>

<p>&nbsp;And voices unlike the voice of man,</p>

<p>&nbsp;As if the fiends kept holiday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scott, LAY OF THE LAST MINSTREL</p>

<p>'Ill news, Martin, I see by your look!' cried Eustacie, starting
to her feet from the heap of straw on which she was sitting in his
cowhouse, one early April day, about seven weeks since her evasion
from the convent.</p>

<p>'Not so, I hope, Madame, but I do not feel at ease.&nbsp;
Monsieur has not sent for me, nor told me his plans for the morrow,
and I much doubt me whether that bode not a search here.&nbsp; Now
I see a plan, provided Madame would trust herself to a
Huguenot.'</p>

<p>'They would guard me for my husband's sake.'</p>

<p>'And could Madame walk half a league, as far as the Grange du
Temple?&nbsp; There live Matthieu Rotrou and his wife, who have,
they say, baffled a hundred times the gendarmes who sought their
ministers.&nbsp; No one ever found a pastor, they say, when Rotrou
had been of the congregation; and if they can do so much for an old
preacher with a long tongue, surely they can for a sweet young
lady; and if they could shelter her just for tomorrow, till the
suspicion is over, then would I come for Madame with my cart, and
carry her into Chollet among the trusses of hay, as we had
fixed.'</p>

<p>Eustacie was already tying her cloak, and asking for Lucette;
but she was grieved to hear that Martin had sent her to vespers to
disarm suspicion, and moreover that he meant not to tell her of his
new device.&nbsp; 'The creature is honest enough,' he said, 'but
the way to be safe with women is not to let them know.'</p>

<p>He cut short all messages and expressions of gratitude, and
leading Eustacie to a small stream, he made her creep along its
course, with her feet in the water so as to be sheltered by the
boughs that hung over the banks, while he used his ling strides to
enable him to double back and enter into conversation with
passers-by, quite of the track of the Grange du Temple, but always
telling her where he should join her again, and leaving with her
the great dog, whom she had come to regard as a friend and
protector.&nbsp; Leaving the brook, he conducted her beneath hedges
and by lonely woodland paths beyond the confines of her own
property, to a secluded valley, so shut in by wooded hills that she
had not been aware of its existence.&nbsp; Through an extensive
orchard, she at length, when nearly spent with the walk, beheld the
cluster of stone buildings, substantial as the erections of
religious orders were wont to be.</p>

<p>Martin found a seat for her, where she might wait while he went
on alone to the house, and presently returned with both the good
people of the farm.&nbsp; They were more offhand and less
deferential than were her own people, but were full of
kindliness.&nbsp; They were middle-aged folk, most neatly clad, and
with a grave, thoughtful look about them, as if life were a much
heavier charge to them than to their light-hearted neighbours.</p>

<p>'A fair day to you, Madame,' said the farmer, doffing his
wide-flapped hat.&nbsp; 'I am glad to serve a sufferer for the
truth's sake.'</p>

<p>'My husband was,' faltered Eustacie.</p>

<p>'AH! <i>la pauvre</i>,' cried the good woman, pressing forward
as she saw how faint, heated, and exhausted was the wanderer.&nbsp;
'Come in, <i>ma pauvrette</i>.&nbsp; Only a bride at the
Bartholomew!&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; There, lean on me, my dear.'</p>

<p>To be <i>tutoyee</i> by the Fermiere Rotrou was a shock; yet the
kind manner was comfortable, and Eustacie suffered herself to be
led into the farm-house, where, as the dame observed, she need not
fear chance-comers, for they lived much to themselves, and no one
would be about till their boy Robinet came in with the cows.&nbsp;
She might rest and eat there in security, and after that they would
find a hiding-place for her--safe as the horns of the altar--for a
night or two; only for two nights at most.</p>

<p>'Nor do I ask more,' said Eustacie.&nbsp; 'Then Martin will come
for me.'</p>

<p>'Ah, I or Blaise, or whichever of us can do it with least
suspicion.'</p>

<p>'She shall meet you here,' added Rotrou.</p>

<p>'All right, good man; I understand; it is best I should not know
where you hide her.&nbsp; Those rogues have tricks that make it as
well to know nothing.&nbsp; Farewell, Madame, I commend you to all
the saints till I come for you on Monday morning.'</p>

<p>Eustacie gave him her hand to kiss, and tried to thank him, but
somehow her heart sank, and she felt more lonely than ever, when
entirely cast loose among these absolute strangers, than amongst
her own vassals.&nbsp; Even the farm-kitchen, large, stone-built,
and scrupulously clean, seemed strange and dreary after the little,
smoky, earth-built living-rooms in which her peasantry were content
to live, and she never had seemed to herself so completely
desolate; but all the time she was so wearied out with her long and
painful walk, that she had no sooner taken some food than she began
to doze in her chair.</p>

<p>'Father,' said the good wife, 'we had better take <i>la
pauvrette</i> to her rest at once.'</p>

<p>'Ah! must I go any farther?' sighed Eustacie.</p>

<p>'It is but a few fields beyond the yard, <i>ma petite</i>,' said
the good woman consolingly; 'and it will be safer to take you there
ere we need a light.'</p>

<p>The sun had just set on a beautiful evening of a spring that
happily for Eustacie had been unusually warm and mild, when they
set forth, the dame having loaded her husband with a roll of
bedding, and herself taking a pitcher of mild and a loaf of bread,
whilst Eustacie, as usual, carried her own small parcel of clothes
and jewels.&nbsp; The way was certainly not long to any one less
exhausted than she; it was along a couple of fields, and then
through a piece of thicket, where Rotrou held back the boughs and
his wife almost dragged her on with kind encouraging words, till
they came up to a stone ivy-covered wall, and coasting along it to
a tower, evidently a staircase turret.&nbsp; Here Rotrou, holding
aside an enormous bush of ivy, showed the foot of a winding
staircase, and his wife assured her that she would not have far to
climb.</p>

<p>She knew where she was now.&nbsp; She had heard of the old
Refectory of the Knights Templars. &nbsp;Partly demolished by the
hatred of the people upon the abolition of the Order, it had ever
since lain waste, and had become the centre of all the ghostly
traditions of the country; the locality of all the most horrid
tales of REVENANTS told under the breath at Dame Perrine's hearth
or at recreation hour at Bellaise.&nbsp; Her courage was not proof
against spiritual terrors.&nbsp; She panted and leant against the
wall, as she faintly exclaimed, 'The Temple--there--and alone!'</p>

<p>'Nay, Lady, methought as <i>Monsieur votre mari</i> knew the
true light, you would fear no vain terror nor power of
darkness.'</p>

<p>Should these peasants--these villeins--be bold, and see the
descendant of the 'bravest of knights,' the daughter of the house
of Ribaumont, afraid?&nbsp; She rallied herself, and replied
manfully, 'I FEAR not, no!' but then, womanfully, 'But it is the
Temple!&nbsp; It is haunted!&nbsp; Tell me what I must expect.'</p>

<p>'I tell you truly, Madame,' said Rotrou; 'none whom I have
sheltered here have seen aught.&nbsp; On the faith of a Christian,
no evil spirit--no ghost--has ever alarmed them; but they were
fortified by prayer and psalm.'</p>

<p>'I do pray!&nbsp; I have a psalm-book,' said Eustacie, and she
added to herself, 'No, they shall never see that I fear.&nbsp;
After all, REVENANTS can do nothing worse than scare one; they
cannot touch one; the saints and angels will not let them--and my
uncle would do much worse.'</p>

<p>But to climb those winding stairs, and resign herself to be left
alone with the Templars for the night, was by far the severest
trial that had yet befallen the poor young fugitive.&nbsp; As her
tire feet dragged up the crumbling steps, her memory reverted to
the many tales of the sounds heard by night within those
walls--church chants turning into diabolical songs, and bewildered
travellers into thickets and morasses, where they had been found in
the morning, shuddering as they told of a huge white monk, with
clanking weapons, and a burning cross of fire printed on his
shoulder and breast, who stood on the walls and hurled a shrieking
babe into the abyss.&nbsp; Were such spectacles awaiting her?&nbsp;
Must she bear them? And could her endurance hold out?&nbsp; Our
Lady be her aid, and spare her in her need!</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs she found Rotrou's hand, ready to help
her out on a stone floor, quite dark, but thickly covered, as she
felt and smelt, with trusses of hay, between which a glimmering
light showed a narrow passage.&nbsp; A few steps, guided by
Rotrou's hand, brought her out into light again, and she found
herself in a large chamber, with the stone floor broken away in
some places, and with a circular window, thickly veiled with ivy,
but still admitting a good deal of evening light.</p>

<p>It was in fact a chamber over the vaulted refectory of the
knights.&nbsp; The walls and vaults still standing in their massive
solidity, must have tempted some peasant, or mayhap some
adventurer, rudely to cover in the roof (which had of course been
stripped of its leading), and thus in the unsuspected space to
secure a hiding-place, often for less innocent commodities than the
salt, which the iniquitous and oppressive <i>gabelle</i> had always
led the French peasant to smuggle, ever since the days of the first
Valois.&nbsp; The room had a certain appearance of comfort; there
was a partition across it, a hearth with some remains of
wood-ashes, a shelf, holding a plate, cup, lamp, and a few other
necessaries; and altogether the aspect of the place was so unlike
what Eustacie had expected, that she almost forgot the Templar as
she saw the dame begin to arrange a comfortable-looking couch for
her wearied limbs.&nbsp; Yet she felt very unwilling to let them
depart, and even ventured on faltering out the inquiry whether the
good woman could not stay with her,--she would reward her
largely.</p>

<p>'It is for the love of Heaven, Madame, not for gain,' said Nanon
Rotrou, rather stiffly.&nbsp; 'If you were ill, or needed me, all
must then give way; but for me to be absent this evening would soon
be reported around the village down there, for there are many who
would find occasion against us.'&nbsp; But, by way of consolation,
they gave her a whistle, and showed her that the window of their
cottage was much nearer to a loophole-slit looking towards the east
than she had fancied.&nbsp; The whistle perpetrated a mist
unearthly screech, a good deal like that of an owl, but more
discordant, and Nanon assured her that the sound would assuredly
break her slumbers, and bring her in a few minutes at any moment of
need.&nbsp; In fact, the noise was so like the best authenticated
accounts of the shrieks indulged in by the spirits of the Temple,
that Eustacie had wit enough to suspect that it might be the
foundation of some of the stories; and with that solace to her
alarms, she endured the departure of her hosts, Nanon promising a
visit in the early morning.</p>

<p>The poor child was too weary to indulge in many terrors, the
beneficent torpor of excessive fatigue was upon her, happily
bringing slumberous oblivion instead of feverish
restlessness.&nbsp; She strove to repeat her accustomed orisons;
but sleep was too strong for her, and she was soon lying
dreamlessly upon the clean homely couch prepared for her.</p>

<p>When she awoke, it was with a start.&nbsp; The moon was shining
in through the circular window, making strange white shapes on the
floor, all quivering with the shadows of the ivy sprays.&nbsp; It
looked strange and eerie enough at the moment, but she understood
it the next, and would have been reassured if she had not become
aware that there was a low sound, a tramp,&nbsp; tramp, below
her.&nbsp; 'Gracious saints!&nbsp; The Templar!&nbsp; Have mercy on
me!&nbsp; Oh! I was too sleepy to pray!&nbsp; Guard me from being
driven wild by fright!'&nbsp; She sat upright, with wide-spread
eyes, and, finding that she herself was in the moonlight, through
some opening in the roof, she took refuge in the darkest corner,
though aware as she crouched there, that if this were indeed the
Templar, concealment would be vain, and remembering suddenly that
she was out of reach of the loophole-window.</p>

<p>And therewith there was a tired sound in the tread, as if the
Templar found his weird a very length one; then a long heavy
breath, with something so essentially human in its sound that the
fluttering heart beat more steadily.&nbsp; If reason told her that
the living were more perilous to her than the dead, yet feeling
infinitely preferred them!&nbsp; It might be Nanon Rotrou after
all; then how foolish to be crouching there in a fright!&nbsp; It
was rustling through the hay.&nbsp; No-no Nanon; it is a male
figure, it has a long cloak on.&nbsp; Ah! it is in the
moonlight-silver hair--silver beard.&nbsp; The Templar!&nbsp;
Fascinated with dismay, yet calling to mind that no ghost has power
unless addressed, she sat still, crossing herself in silence, but
unable to call to mind any prayer or invocation save a continuous
'Ave Mary,' and trying to restrain her gasping breath, lest, if he
were not the Templar after all, he might discover her presence.</p>

<p>He moved about, took off his cloak, laid it down near the hay,
then his cap, not a helmet after all, and there was no fiery
cross.</p>

<p>He was in the gloom again, and she heard him moving much as
though he were pulling down the hay to form a bed.&nbsp; Did ghosts
ever do anything so sensible?&nbsp; If he were an embodied spirit,
would it be possible to creep past him and escape while he lay
asleep?&nbsp; She was almost becoming familiarized with the
presence, and the supernatural terror was passing off into a
consideration of resources, when, behold, he was beginning to
sing.&nbsp; To sing was the very way the ghosts began ere they came
to their devilish outcries.&nbsp; 'Our Lady keep it from bringing
frenzy.&nbsp; But hark! hark!'&nbsp; It was not one of the chants,
it was a tune and words heard in older times of her life; it was
the evening hymn, that the little husband and wife had been wont to
sing to the Baron in the Chateau de Leurre--</p>

<p>Marot's version of the 4<sup>th</sup> Psalm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>'Plus de joie m'est donnee</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Par ce moyen, O Dieu Tres-Haut,</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Que n'ont ceux qui ont grand
annee</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>De froment et bonne vinee,</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>D'huile et tout ce qu'il leur
faut.'</i></p>

<p>If it had indeed been the ghostly chant, perhaps Eustacie would
not have been able to help joining it.&nbsp; As it was, the
familiar home words irresistibly impelled her to mingle her voice,
scarce knowing what she did, in the verse--</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>'Si qu'en paix et surete bonne</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Coucherai et reposerai ;</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Car, Seigneur, ta bonte tout
ordonne</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Et elle seule espoir me donne</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Que sur et seul regnant
serai.'&nbsp;</i></p>

<p>The hymn died away in its low cadence, and then, ere Eustacie
had had time to think of the consequences of thus raising her
voice, the new-comer demanded:</p>

<p>'Is there then another wanderer here?'</p>

<p>'Ah! sir, pardon me!' she exclaimed.&nbsp; 'I will not long
importune you, but only till morning light--only till the Fermiere
Rotrou comes.'</p>

<p>'If Matthieu and Anne Rotrou placed you here, then all is well,'
replied the stranger.&nbsp; 'Fear not, daughter, but tell me.&nbsp;
Are you one of my scattered flock, or one whose parents are known
to me?'&nbsp; Then, as she hesitated, 'I am Isaac Gardon--escaped,
alas! alone, from the slaughter of the Barthelemy.'</p>

<p>'Master Gardon!' cried Eustacie.&nbsp; 'Oh, I know!&nbsp; O sir,
my husband loved and honoured you.'</p>

<p>'Your husband?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, le Baron de Ribaumont.'</p>

<p>'That fair and godly youth!&nbsp; My dear old patron's
son!&nbsp; You--you!&nbsp; But--' with a shade of doubt, almost of
dismay, 'the boy was wedded--wedded to the heiress---'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, I am that unhappy one!&nbsp; We were to have fled
together on that dreadful night.&nbsp; He came to meet me to the
Louvre--to his doom!' she gasped out, nearer to tears than she had
ever been since that time, such a novelty was it to her to hear
Berenger spoken of in kind or tender terms; and in her warmth of
feeling, she came out of her corner, and held our her hand to
him.</p>

<p>'Alas! poor thing!' said the minister, compassionately, 'Heaven
has tried you sorely.&nbsp; Had I known of your presence here, I
would not have entered; but I have been absent long, and stole into
my lair here without disturbing the good people below.&nbsp;
Forgive the intrusion, Madame.'</p>

<p>The minister replied warmly that surely persecution was a
brotherhood, even had she not been the window of one he had loved
and lamented.</p>

<p>'Ah! sir, it does me good to hear you say so.'</p>

<p>And therewith Eustacie remembered the hospitalities of her
loft.&nbsp; She perceived by the tones of the old man's voice that
he was tired, and probably fasting, and she felt about for the milk
and bread with which she had been supplied.&nbsp; It was a most
welcome refreshment, though he only partook sparingly; and while he
ate, the two, so strangely met, came to a fuller knowledge of one
another's circumstances.</p>

<p>Master Isaac Gardon had, it appeared, been residing at Paris, in
the house of the watchmaker whose daughter had been newly married
to his son; but on the fatal eve of St. Bartholomew, he had been
sent for to pray with a sick person in another quarter of the
city.&nbsp; The Catholic friends of the invalid were humane, and
when the horrors began, not only concealed their kinsman, but
almost forcibly shut up the minister in the same cellar with
him.&nbsp; And thus, most reluctantly, had he been spared from the
fate that overtook his son and daughter-in-law.&nbsp; A lone and
well-night broken-hearted man, he had been smuggled out of the
city, and had since that time been wandering from one to another of
the many scattered settlements of Huguenots in the northern part of
France, who, being left pastorless, welcomed visits from the
minister of their religion, and passed him on from one place to
another, as his stay in each began to be suspected by the
authorities.&nbsp; He was now on his way along the west side of
France, with no fixed purpose, except so far as, since Heaven had
spared his life when all that made it dear had been taken from him,
he resigned himself to believe that there was yet some duty left
for him to fulfil.</p>

<p>Meantime the old man was wearied out; and after due courtesies
had passed between him and the lady in the dark, he prayed long and
fervently, as Eustacie could judge from the intensity of the low
murmurs she heard; and then she heard him, with a heavy
irrepressible sigh, lie down on the couch of hay he had already
prepared for himself, and soon his regular breathings announced his
sound slumbers.&nbsp; She was already on the bed she had so
precipitately quitted, and not a thought more did she give to the
Templars, living or dead, even though she heard an extraordinary
snapping and hissing, and in the dawn of the morning saw a white
weird thing, like a huge moth, flit in through the circular window,
take up its station on a beam above the hay, and look down with the
brightest, roundest eyes she had ever beheld.&nbsp; Let owls and
bats come where they would, she was happier than she had been for
months.&nbsp; Compassion for herself was plentiful enough, but to
have heard Berenger spoken of with love and admiration seemed to
quiet the worst ache of her lonely heart.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.&nbsp; THE MOONBEAM</h3>

<p>She wandered east, she wandered west,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wandered out and in;</p>

<p>And at last into the very swine's stythe</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen brought forth a son.--Fause
Foodrage</p>

<p>The morrow was Sunday, and in the old refectory, in the late
afternoon, a few Huguenots, warned by messages from the farm, met
to profit by one of their scanty secret opportunities for public
worship.&nbsp; The hum of the prayer, and discourse of the pastor,
rose up through the broken vaulting to Eustacie, still lying on her
bed; for she had been much shaken by the fatigues of the day and
alarm of the night, and bitterly grieved, too, by a message which
Nanon conveyed to her, that poor Martin was in no state to come for
her in the next day; but he and his wife having been seized upon by
Narcisse and his men, and so savagely beaten in order to force from
them a confession of her hiding-place, that both were lying
helpless on their bed; and could only send an entreaty by the
trustworthy fool, that Rotrou would find means of conveying Madame
into Chollet in some cart of hay or corn, in which she could be
taken past the barriers.</p>

<p>But this was not to be.&nbsp; Good Nanon had sacrificed the
sermon to creep up to Eustacie, and when the congregation were
dispersing in the dusk, she stole down the stairs to her husband;
and a few seconds after he was hurrying as fast as <i>detours</i>
would allow him to Blaise's farm.&nbsp; An hour and a half later,
Dame Perrine, closely blindfolded for the last mile, was dragged up
the spiral staircase, and ere the bandage was removed heard
Eustacie's voice, with a certain cheeriness, say, 'Oh! nurse; my
son will soon come!'</p>

<p>The full moon gave her light, and the woman durst not have any
other, save from the wood-fire that Nanon had cautiously lighted
and screened.&nbsp; The moonshine was still supreme, when some time
later a certain ominous silence and half-whisper between the two
women at the hearth made Eustacie, with a low cry of terror,
exclaim, 'Nurse, nurse, what means this?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; He
lives!&nbsp; I know he lives!&nbsp; Perrine, I command you tell
me!'</p>

<p>'Living!&nbsp; Oh, yes, my love, my Lady,' answered Perrine,
returning towards her; 'fair and perfect as the day.&nbsp; Be not
disquieted for a moment.'</p>

<p>'I will--I will disquiet myself,' panted Eustacie, 'unless you
tell me what is amiss.'</p>

<p>'Nothing amiss,' said Nanon, gruffly.&nbsp; 'Madame will give
thanks for this fair gift of a daughter.'</p>

<p>It must be owned the words felt chill.&nbsp; She had never
thought of this!&nbsp; It was as if the being for whom she had
dared and suffered so much, in the trust that he would be
Berenger's representative and avenger, had failed her and
disappointed her.&nbsp; No defender, no paladin, no so to be proud
of!&nbsp; Her heart and courage sank down in her weakness as they
had never done before; and, without speaking, she turned her head
away towards the darkness, feeling as if had been for nothing, and
she might as well sink away in her exhaustion. Mere Perrine was
more angry with Nanon than conscious of her Lady's weakness.&nbsp;
'Woman, you speak as if you knew not the blow to this family, and
to all who hoped for better days.&nbsp; What, that my Lady, the
heiress, who ought to be in a bed of state, with velvet curtains,
lace pillows, gold caudle-cups, should be here in a vile ruin,
among owls and bats, like any beggar, and all for the sake, not of
a young Lord to raise up the family, but of a miserable little
girl!&nbsp; Had I known how it would turn out, I had never meddled
in this mad scheme.'</p>

<p>Before Nanon could express her indignation, Eustacie had turned
her head opened her eyes, and called out, 'Miserable!&nbsp; Oh!
what do you mean?&nbsp; Oh, it is true, Nanon? is it well with
her?</p>

<p>'As well as heart could wish,' answered Nanon, cheerily.&nbsp;
'Small, but a perfect little piece of sugar.&nbsp; There, Lady, she
shall speak for herself.'</p>

<p>And as Nanon laid the babe on the young mother's bosom, the
thrilling touch at once put an end to all the repinings of the
heiress, and awoke far other instincts.</p>

<p>'My child! my little one, my poor little orphan--all cruel to
her!&nbsp; Oh, no welcome even from thy mother!&nbsp; Babe, babe,
pardon me, I will make it up to thee; indeed I will!&nbsp; Oh! let
me see her!&nbsp; Do not take her away, dear good woman, only hold
her in the moonlight!'</p>

<p>The full rays of the moon, shining through the gable window,
streamed down very near where Eustacie lay, and by a slight
movement Dame Rotrou was able to render the little face as
distinctly visible to her as if it had been daylight, save that the
blanching light was somewhat embellishing to the new-born
complexion, and increased that curious resemblance so often borne
for the first few hours of life to the future self.&nbsp;
Eustacie's cry at once was, 'Himself, himself--his very face!&nbsp;
Let me have her, my own moonbeam--his child--my joy!'</p>

<p>The tears, so long denied, rushed down like summer rain as she
clasped the child in her arms.&nbsp; Dame Perrine wandered to and
fro, like one beside herself, not only at her Lady's wretched
accommodations, but at the ill omens of the moonlight illumination,
of the owls who snapped and hissed incessantly over the hay, and
above all the tears over the babe's face.&nbsp; She tried to
remonstrate with Eustacie, but was answered only, 'Let me
weep!&nbsp; Oh, let me weep!&nbsp; It eases my heart!&nbsp; It
cannot hurt my little one!&nbsp; She cannot weep for her father
herself, so I must weep for her.'</p>

<p>The weeping was gentle, not violent; and Dame Rotrou thought it
did good rather than harm.&nbsp; She was chiefly anxious to be quit
of Perrine, who, however faithful to the Lady of Ribaumont, must
not be trusted to learn the way to this Huguenot asylum, and must
be escorted back by Rotrou ere peep of dawn.&nbsp; The old woman
knew that her own absence from home would be suspicious, and with
many grumblings submitted; but first she took the child from
Eustacie's reluctant arms, promising to restore her in a few
moments, after finishing dressing her in the lace-edged swaddling
bands so carefully preserved ever since Eustacie's own baby
hood.&nbsp; In these moments she had taken them all by surprise by,
without asking any questions, sprinkling the babe with water, and
baptizing her by the hereditary name of Berangere, the feminine of
the only name Eustacie had always declared her son should
bear.&nbsp; Such baptisms were not unfrequently performed by French
nurses, but Eustacie exclaimed with a sound half dismay, half
indignation.</p>

<p><i>'Eh quoi</i>!' said Perrine, 'it is only <i>
ondoyee</i>.&nbsp; You can have all the ceremonies if ever time
shall fit; but do you think I could leave my Lady's child--mere
girl though it be--alone with owls, and <i>follets</i>, and <i>
revenents</i>, and heretics, and she unbaptized?&nbsp; She would be
a changeling long ere morning, I trow.'</p>

<p>'Come, good woman,' said Rotrou, from between the trusses of hay
at the entrance; 'you and I must begin our Colin-Mail-lard again,
or it may be the worse for us both.'</p>

<p>And with the promise of being conducted to Eustacie again in
three nights' time, if she would meet her guide at the cross-roads
after dark, Perrine was forced to take her leave.&nbsp; She had
never suspected that all this time Maitre Gardon had been hidden in
the refectory below, and still less did she guess that soon after
her departure the old man was installed as her Lady's chief
attendant.&nbsp; It was impossible that Nanon should stay with
Eustacie; she had her day's work to attend to, and her absence
would have excited suspicion.&nbsp; He, therefore, came partly up
the stairs, and calling to Nanon, proffered himself to sit with <i>
'cette pauvre</i>,' and make a signal in case Nanon should be
wanted.&nbsp; The good woman was thus relieved of a great
care.&nbsp; She would not have dared to ask it of him, but with a
low reverence, she owned that it was an act of great charity
towards the poor lady, who, she hoped, was falling into a tranquil
sleep, but who she would hardly have dared to leave.&nbsp; The
pastor, though hardships, battles, and persecutions had left him
childless, had been the father of a large family; and perhaps he
was drawn the more strongly towards the mother and child, because
he almost felt as if, in fulfilling the part of a father towards
the widow of Berenger de Ribaumont, he was taking her in the stead
of the widow of his own Theodore.</p>

<p>Had the little Baronne de Ribaumont been lodged in a tapes-tried
chamber, between curtains of velvet and gold, with a <i>
beauffet</i> by her side glistening with gold and silver plate, as
would have befitted her station, instead of lying on a bed of
straw, with no hangings to the walls save cobwebs and hay, and
wallflowers, no <i>beauffet</i> but the old rickety table, no
attendants but Nanon and M. Gardon, no visitors but the two white
owls, no provisions save the homely fare that rustic mothers lived
upon--neither she nor her babe could have thriven better, and
probably not half so well.&nbsp; She had been used to a hardy,
out-of-door life, like the peasant women; and she was young and
strong, so that she recovered as they did.&nbsp; If the April
shower beat in at the window, or the hole in the roof, they made a
screen of canvas, covered her with cloaks, and heaped them with
hay, and she took no harm; and the pure open air that blew in was
soft with all the southern sweetness of early spring-tide, and the
little one throve in it like the puff-ball owlets in the hayloft,
or the little ring-doves in the ivy, whose parent's cooing voice
was Eustacie's favourite music.&nbsp; Almost as good as these her
fellow-nestlings was the little Moonbeam, <i>la petite
Rayonette</i>, as Eustacie fondly called this light that had come
back to her from the sunshine she had lost. Had she cried or been
heard, the sounds would probably have passed for the wailings of
the ghostly victims of the Templars, but she exercised an exemplary
forbearance in that respect, for which Eustacie thought she could
not be sufficiently admired.</p>

<p>Like the child she was, Eustacie seemed to have put care from
her, and to be solely taken up with the baby, and the amusement of
watching the owl family.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the search at this moment, for the Chevalier
had been recalled to Paris by the fatal illness of his son-in-law,
M. de Selinvine.&nbsp; The old soldier, after living half his life
on bread and salad, that he might keep up a grand appearance at
Paris, had, on coming into the wealth of the family, and marrying a
beautiful wife, returned to the luxuries he had been wont only to
enjoy for a few weeks at a time, with in military occupation of
some Italian town.&nbsp; Three months of festivities had been
enough to cause his death; and the Chevalier was summoned to assist
his daughter in providing for his obsequies, and in taking
possession of the huge endowments which, as the last of his race,
he had been able to bequeath to her.&nbsp; Such was the news
brought by the old nurse Perrine, who took advantage of the
slackening vigilance of the enemy to come to see Eustacie.&nbsp;
The old woman was highly satisfied; for one of the peasants' wives
had--as if on purpose to oblige her Lady--given birth to twins, one
of whom had died almost immediately; and the parents had consented
to conceal their loss, and at once take the little Demoiselle de
Ribaumont as their own-- guarding the secret till her mother should
be able to claim her.&nbsp; It was so entirely the practice, under
the most favourable circumstances, for French mothers to send their
infants to be nursed in cottages, that Perrine was amazed by the
cry of angry refusal that burst from Eustacie: "Part with my
child!&nbsp; leave her to her enemies!--never! never!&nbsp; Hold
your tongue, Perrine!&nbsp; I will not hear of such a thing!'</p>

<p>'But, Madame, hear reason.&nbsp; She will pass for one of
Simonette's!'</p>

<p>'She shall pass for none but mine!--I part with thee,
indeed!&nbsp; All that is left me of thy father!--the poor little
orphaned innocent, that no one loves but her mother!'</p>

<p>'Madame--Mademoiselle, this is not common sense!&nbsp; Why, how
can you hide yourself? how travel with a baby on your neck, whose
crying may betray you?'</p>

<p>'She never cries--never, never!&nbsp; And better I were betrayed
than she.'</p>

<p>'If it were a boy---' began Perrine.</p>

<p>'If it were a boy, there would be plenty to care for it.&nbsp; I
should not care for it half so much. As for my poor little lonely
girl, whom every one wishes away but her mother--ah! yes, baby, thy
mother will go through fire and water for thee yet.&nbsp; Never
fear, thou shalt not leave her!'</p>

<p>'No nurse can go with Madame.&nbsp; Simonette could not leave
her home.'</p>

<p>'What needs a nurse when she has me?'</p>

<p>'But, Madame,' proceeded the old woman, out of patience, 'you
are beside yourself!&nbsp; What noble lady ever nursed her
babe?'</p>

<p>'I don't care noble ladies--I care for my child,' said the
vehement, petulant little thing.</p>

<p>'And how--what good will Madame's caring for it do?&nbsp; What
knows she of infants?&nbsp; How can she take care of it?'</p>

<p>'Our Lady will teach me,' said Eustacie, still pressing the
child passionately to her heart; 'and see--the owl--the
ring-dove--can take care of their little ones; the good God shows
them how--He will tell me how!'</p>

<p>Perrine regarded her Lady much as if she were in a naughty fit,
refusing unreasonably to part with a new toy, and Nanon Rotrou was
much of the same mind; but it was evident that if at the moment
they attempted to carry off the babe, the other would put herself
into an agony of passion, that they durst not call forth; and they
found it needful to do their best to soothe her out of the deluge
of agitated tears that fell from her eyes, as she grasped the child
so convulsively that she might almost have stifled it at
once.&nbsp; They assured her that they would not take it away
now--not now, at any rate; and when the latent meaning made her
fiercely insist that it was to leave her neither now nor ever,
Perrine made pacifying declarations that it should be just as she
pleased--promises that she knew well, when in that coaxing voice,
meant nothing at all.&nbsp; Nothing calmed her till Perrine had
been conducted away; and even then Nanon could not hush her into
anything like repose, and at last called in the minister, in
despair.</p>

<p>'Ah! sir, you are a wise man; can you find how to quiet the poor
little thing?&nbsp; Her nurse has nearly driven her distracted with
talking of the foster-parents she has found for the child.'</p>

<p>'Not found!' cried Eustacie.&nbsp; 'No, for she shall never
go!'</p>

<p>'There!' lamented Nanon--'so she agitates herself, when it is
but spoken of.&nbsp; And surely she had better make up her mind,
for there is no other choice.'</p>

<p>'Nay, Nanon,' said M. Gardon, 'wherefore should she part with
the charge that God has laid on her?'</p>

<p>Eustacie gave a little cry of grateful joy.&nbsp; 'Oh, sir, come
nearer!&nbsp; Do you, indeed, say that they have no right to tear
her from me?'</p>

<p>'Surely not, Lady.&nbsp; It is you whose duty it is to shield
and guard her.'</p>

<p>'Oh, sir, tell me again!&nbsp; Yours is the right
religion.&nbsp; Oh, you are the minister for me!&nbsp; If you will
tell me I ought to keep my child, then I will believe everything
else.&nbsp; I will do just as you tell me.'&nbsp; And she stretched
out both hands to him, with vehement eagerness.</p>

<p>'Poor thing!&nbsp; This is no matter of one religion or
another,' said the minister; 'it is rather the duty that the
Almighty hath imposed, and that He hath made an eternal joy.'</p>

<p>'Truly,' said Nanon, ashamed at having taken the other side:
'the good <i>pasteur</i> says what is according to nature.&nbsp; It
would have gone hard with me if any one had wished to part me from
Robin or Sara; but these fine ladies, and, for that matter, <i>
bourgeoisies</i> too, always do put out their babes; and it seemed
to me that Madame would find it hard to contrive for herself--let
alone the little one.'</p>

<p>'Ah! but what would be the use of contriving for myself, without
her?' said Eustacie.</p>

<p>If all had gone well and prosperously with Madame de Ribaumont,
probably she would have surrendered an infant born in purple and in
pall to the ordinary lot of its contemporaries; but the exertions
and suffering she had undergone on behalf of her child, its
orphanhood, her own loneliness, and even the general disappointment
in its sex, had given it a hold on her vehement, determined heart,
that intensified to the utmost the instincts of motherhood; and she
listened as if to an angle's voice as Maitre Gardon replied to
Nanon--</p>

<p>'I say not that it is not the custom; nay, that my blessed wife
and myself have not followed it; but we have so oft had cause to
repent the necessity, that far be it from me ever to bid a woman
forsake her sucking child.'</p>

<p>'Is that Scripture?' asked Eustacie.&nbsp; 'Ah! sir, sir, tell
me more!&nbsp; You are giving me all--all--my child!&nbsp; I will
be--I am--a Huguenot like her father! and, when my vassals come, I
will make them ride with you to La Rochelle, and fight in your
cause!'</p>

<p>'Nay,' said Maitre Gardon, taken by surprise; 'but, Lady, your
vassals are Catholic.'</p>

<p>'What matters it?&nbsp; In my cause they shall fight!' said the
feudal Lady, 'for me and my daughter!'</p>

<p>And as the pastor uttered a sound of interrogative astonishment,
she continued--</p>

<p>'As soon as I am well enough, Blaise will send out messages, and
they will meet me at midnight at the cross-roads, Martin and all,
for dear good Martin is quite well now, and we shall ride across
country, avoiding towns, wherever I choose to lead them.&nbsp; I
had thought of Chantilly, for I know M. de Montmorency would stand
my friend against a Guisard; but now, now I know you, sir, let me
escort you to La Rochelle, and do your cause service worthy of Nid
de Merle and Ribaumont!'&nbsp; And as she sat up on her bed, she
held up her little proud head, and waved her right hand with the
grace and dignity of a queen offering an alliance of her realm.</p>

<p>Maitre Gardon, who had hitherto seen her as a childish though
cheerful and patient sufferer, was greatly amazed, but he could not
regard her project as practicable, or in his conscience approve it;
and after a moment's consideration he answered, 'I am a man of
peace, Lady, and seldom side with armed men, nor would I lightly
make one of those who enroll themselves against the King.'</p>

<p>'Not after all the Queen-mother had done!' cried Eustacie.</p>

<p>'Martyrdom is better than rebellion,' quietly answered the old
man, folding his hands.&nbsp; Then he added 'Far be it from me to
blame those who have drawn the sword for the faith; yet, Lady, it
would not be even thus with your peasants; they might not follow
you.'</p>

<p>'Then,' said Eustacie, with flashing eyes, 'they would be
traitors.'</p>

<p>'Not to the King,' said the pastor, gently.&nbsp; 'Also, Lady,
how will it be with their homes and families--the hearths that have
given you such faithful shelter?'</p>

<p>'The women would take to the woods,' readily answered she; 'it
is summer-time, and they should be willing to bear something for my
sake.&nbsp; I should grieve indeed,' she added, 'if my uncle
misused them.&nbsp; They have been very good to me, but then they
belong to me.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Lady, put from you that hardening belief of
seigneurs.&nbsp; Think what their fidelity deserves from their
Lady.'</p>

<p>'I will be good to them!&nbsp; I do love them!&nbsp; I will be
their very good mistress,' said Eustacie, her eyes filling.</p>

<p>'The question is rather of forbearing than of doing,' said the
minister.</p>

<p>'But what would you have me do?' asked Eustacie, petulantly.</p>

<p>'This, Lady.&nbsp; I gather that you would not return to your
relations.'</p>

<p>'Never! never!&nbsp; They would rend my babe from me; they would
kill her, or at least hide her for ever in a convent--they would
force me into this abhorrent marriage.&nbsp; No--no--no--my child
and I would die a hundred deaths together rather than fall into the
hands of Narcisse.'</p>

<p>'Calm yourself, Lady; there is no present fear, but I deem that
the safest course for the little one would be to place her in
England.&nbsp; She must be heiress to lands and estates there; is
she not?'</p>

<p>'Yes; and in Normandy.'</p>

<p>'And your husband's mother lives?&nbsp; Wherefore then should
you not take me for your guide, and make your way--more secretly
than would be possible with a peasant escort--to one of your
Huguenot towns on the coast, whence you could escape with the child
to England?'</p>

<p>'My <i>belle-mere</i> has re-married!&nbsp; She has
children!&nbsp; I would not bring the daughter of Ribaumont as a
suppliant to be scorned!' said Eustacie, pouting.&nbsp; 'She has
lands enough of her own.'</p>

<p>'There is no need to discuss the question now,' said M. Gardon,
gravely; for a most kind offer, involving much peril and
inconvenience to himself, was thus petulantly flouted.&nbsp;
'Madame will think at her leisure of what would have been the
wishes of Monsieur le Baron for his child.'</p>

<p>He then held himself aloof, knowing that it was not well for her
health, mental or bodily, to talk any more, and a good deal
perplexed himself by the moods of his strange little impetuous
convert, if convert she could be termed.&nbsp; He himself was a
deeply learned scholar, who had studied all the bearings of the
controversy; and, though bound to the French Reformers who would
gladly have come to terms with the Catholics at the Conference of
Plassy, and regretted the more decided Calvinism that his party had
since professed, and in which the Day of St. Bartholomew confirmed
them.&nbsp; He had a strong sense of the grievous losses they
suffered by their disunion from the Church.&nbsp; The Reformed were
less and less what his ardent youthful hopes had trusted to see
them; and in his old age he was a sorrow-stricken man, as much for
the cause of religion as for personal bereavements.&nbsp; He had
little desire to win proselytes, but rather laid his hand to build
up true religion where he found it suffering shocks in these
unsettled, neglected times; and his present wish was rather to form
and guide this little wilful warm-hearted mother--whom he could not
help regarding with as much affection as pity--to find a home in
the Church that had been her husband's, than to gain her to his own
party.&nbsp; And most assuredly he would never let her involve
herself, as she was ready to do, in the civil war, without even
knowing the doctrine which grave and earnest men had preferred to
their loyalty.</p>

<p>He could hear her murmuring to her baby, 'No, no, little one, we
are not fallen so low as to beg our bread among strangers.'&nbsp;
To live upon her own vassals had seemed to her only claiming her
just rights, but it galled her to think of being beholden to
stranger Huguenots; and England and her mother-in-law, without
Berenger, were utterly foreign and distasteful to her.</p>

<p>Her mood was variable.&nbsp; Messages from Blaise and Martin
came and went, and it became known that her intended shelter at
Chollet, together with all the adjacent houses, had been closely
searched by the younger Ribaumont in conjunction with the governor;
so that it was plain that some treachery must exist, and that she
only owed her present freedom to her detention in the ruined
temple; and it would be necessary to leave that as soon as it was
possible for her to attempt the journey.</p>

<p>The plan that seemed most feasible to the vassals was, that
Rotrou should convey her in a cart of fagots as far as possible on
the road to Paris; that there his men should meet her by different
roads, riding their farm-horses--and Martin even hoped to be able
to convey her own palfrey to her from the monastery stable, and
thence, taking a long stretch across country, they trusted to be
able to reach the lands of a dependant of the house of Montmorency,
who would not readily yield her up to a Guise's man.&nbsp; But,
whether instigated by Perrine, or by their own judgment, the
vassals declared that, though Madame should be conducted wherever
she desired, it was impossible to encumber themselves with the
infant.&nbsp; Concealment would be impossible; rough, hasty rides
would be retarded, her difficulties would be tenfold increased, and
the little one would become a means of tracing her.&nbsp; There was
no choice but to leave it with Simonette.</p>

<p>Angrily and haughtily did Eustacie always reject this
alternative, and send fresh commands back by her messenger, to meet
the same reply in another form.&nbsp; The strong will and practical
resolution of the stout farmers, who were about to make a terrible
venture for her, and might reasonably think they had a right to
prescribe the terms that they thought best.&nbsp; All this time
Maitre Gardon felt it impossible to leave her, still weak and
convalescent, alone in the desolate ruin with her young child;
though still her pride would not bend again to seek the counsel
that she had so much detested, nor to ask for the instruction that
was to make her 'believe like her husband.'&nbsp; If she might not
fight for the Reformed, it seemed as if she would none of their
doctrine!</p>

<p>But, true lady that she was, she sunk the differences in her
intercourse with him.&nbsp; She was always prettily and
affectionately grateful for every service that he rendered her, and
as graciously polite as though she had been keeping house in the
halls of Ribaumont.&nbsp; Then her intense love for her child was
so beautiful, and there was so much sweetness in the cheerful
patience with which she endured the many hardships of her
situation, that he could not help being strongly interested in the
wilful, spirited little being.</p>

<p>And thus time passed, until one night, when Martin ventured over
the farm with a report so serious that Rotrou, at all risks,
brought him up to communicate his own tidings.&nbsp; Some one had
given information, Veronique he suspected, and the two Chevaliers
were certainly coming the next day to search with fire the old
buildings of the temple.&nbsp; It was already dawning towards
morning, and it would be impossible to do more at present than to
let Rotrou build up the lady in a vault, some little way off,
whence, after the search was over, she could be released, and join
her vassals the next night according to the original design.&nbsp;
As to the child, her presence in the vault was impossible, and
Martin had actually brought her intended nurse, Simonette, to
Rotrou's cottage to receive her.</p>

<p>'Never!' was all Eustacie answered.&nbsp; 'Save both of us, or
neither.'</p>

<p>'Lady,' said M. Gardon as she looked towards him, 'I go my way
with my staff.'</p>

<p>'And you--you more faithful than her vassals--will let me take
her?'</p>

<p>'Assuredly.'</p>

<p>'Then, sir, even to the world's end will I go with you'</p>

<p>Martin would have argued, have asked, but she would not listen
to him.&nbsp; It was Maitre Gardon who made him understand the
project.&nbsp; There was what in later times has been termed an
underground railway amid the persecuted Calvinists, and M. Gardon
knew his ground well enough to have little doubt of being able to
conduct the lady safely to some town on the coast, whence she might
reach her friends in England.&nbsp; The plan highly satisfied
Martin.&nbsp; It relieved him and his neighbours from the necessity
of provoking perilous wrath, and it was far safer for her herself
than endeavouring to force her way with an escort too large not to
attract notice, yet not warlike enough for efficient defence.&nbsp;
He offered no further opposition, but augured that after all she
would come back a fine lady, and right them all.</p>

<p>Eustacie, recovering from her anger, and recollecting his
services, gave him her hand to kiss, and bade him farewell with a
sudden effusion of gratitude and affection that warmed the honest
fellow's heart.&nbsp; Rewards could not be given, lest they should
become a clue for her uncle; and perhaps they would have wounded
both him and their kind hosts, who did their best to assist her in
their departure.&nbsp; A hasty meal was provided by Nanon, and a
basket so stored as to obviate the need of entering a village, on
that day at least, to purchase provisions; Eustacie's money and
jewels again formed the nucleus of the bundle of clothes and spare
swaddling-banks of her babe; her peasant dress was carefully
arranged--a stout striped cloth skit and black bodice, the latter
covered by a scarlet Chollet kerchief.&nbsp; The winged white cap
entirely hid her hair; a gray cloak with a hood could either fold
round her and her child or be strapped on her shoulders.&nbsp; Her
<i>sabots</i> were hung on her shoulder, for she had learnt to go
barefoot, and walked much more lightly thus; and her little bundle
was slung on a staff on the back of Maitre Gardon, who in his great
peasant's hat and coat looked so like a picture of St. Joseph, that
Eustacie, as the light of the rising sun fell on his white beard
and hair, was reminded of the Flight into Egypt, and came close to
him, saying shyly, 'Our Blessed Lady will bless and feel for my
baby.&nbsp; She knows what this journey is.'</p>

<p>'The Son of the Blessed Mary assuredly knows and blesses,' he
answered.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.&nbsp; LA RUE DES TROIS FEES</h3>

<p>And round the baby fast and close</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her trembling grasp she folds.</p>

<p>And with a strong convulsive grasp</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little infant holds.--SOUTHEY.</p>

<p>A wild storm had raged all the afternoon, hail and rain had
careered on the wings of the wind along the narrow street of the
Three Fairies, at the little Huguenot bourg of La Sablerie;
torrents of rain had poached the unpaved soil into a depth of mud,
and thunder had reverberated over the chimney-tops, and growled far
away over the Atlantic, whose angry waves were tossing on the low
sandy coast about two miles from the town.</p>

<p>The evening had closed in with a chill, misty drizzle, and,
almost May though it were, the Widow Noemi Laurent gladly closed
the shutters of her unglazed window, where small cakes and other
delicate confections were displayed, and felt the genial warmth of
the little fire with which she heated her tiny oven.&nbsp; She was
the widow of a pastor who had suffered for his faith in the last
open persecution, and being the daughter of a baker, the
authorities of the town had permitted her to support herself and
her son by carrying on a trade in the more delicate 'subtilties' of
the art, which were greatly relished at the civic feasts.&nbsp;
Noemi was a grave, sad woman, very lonely ever since she had saved
enough to send her son to study for the ministry in Switzerland,
and with an aching heart that longed to be at rest from the toil
that she looked on as a steep ladder on her way to a better
home.&nbsp; She occupied two tiny rooms on the ground-floor of a
tall house; and she had just arranged her few articles of furniture
with the utmost neatness, when there was a low knock at her door, a
knock that the persecuted well understood, and as she lifted the
latch, a voice she had known of old spoke the scriptural
salutation, 'Peace be with this house.'</p>

<p><i>'Eh quoi</i>, Master Isaac, is it thou?&nbsp; Come in--in a
good hour-- ah!'</p>

<p>As, dripping all round his broad hat and from every thread of
his gray mantle, the aged traveller drew into the house a female
figure whom he had been supporting on his other arm, muffled head
and shoulders in a soaked cloak, with a petticoat streaming with
wet, and feet and ankles covered with mire, 'Here we are, my
child,' he said tenderly, as he almost carried her to Noemi's
chair.&nbsp; Noemi, with kind exclamations of '<i>La pauvre</i>!
<i>la pauvre</i>!' helped the trembling cold hand to open the wet
cloak, and then cried out with fresh surprise and pity at the sight
of the fresh little infant face, nestled warm and snug under all
the wrappings in those weary arms.</p>

<p>'See,' said the poor wanderer, looking up to the old man, with a
faint smile; 'she is well--she is warm--it hurts her
not.'&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Can you take us in?' added M. Gardon, hastily; 'have you
room?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes; if you can sleep on the floor here, I will take this
poor dear to my own bed directly,' said Noemi.&nbsp; '<i>Tenez</i>'
opening a chest; 'you will find dry clothes there, of my
husband's.&nbsp; And thou,' helping Eustacie up with her strong
arm, and trying to take the little one, 'let me warm and dry thee
within.'</p>

<p>Too much worn out to make resistance, almost past speaking,
knowing merely that she had reached the goal that had been promised
her throughout these weary days, feeling warmth, and hearing kind
tones, Eustacie submitted to be led into the inner room; and when
the good widow returned again, it was in haste to fetch some of the
warm <i>potage</i> she had already been cooking over the fire, and
hastily bade M. Gardon help himself to the rest.&nbsp; She came
back again with the babe, to wash and dress it in the warmth of her
oven fire.&nbsp; Maitre Gardon, in the black suit of a Calvinist
pastor, had eaten his <i>potage</i>, and was anxiously awaiting her
report.&nbsp; 'Ah!&nbsp; <i>la pauvre</i>, with His blessing she
will sleep! she will do well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But how far did you come to-day?'</p>

<p>'From Sainte Lucie.&nbsp; From the Grange du Temple since
Monday.'</p>

<p>'Ah! is it possible?&nbsp; The poor child!&nbsp; And this little
one--sure, it is scarce four weeks old?'</p>

<p>'Four weeks this coming Sunday.'</p>

<p>'Ah! the poor thing.&nbsp; The blessing of Heaven must have been
with you to bear her through.&nbsp; And what a lovely infant--how
white--what beauteous little limbs!&nbsp; Truly, she has sped
well.&nbsp; Little did I think, good friend, that you had this
comfort left, or that our poor Theodore's young wife had
escaped.'</p>

<p>'Alas! no, Noemi; this is no child of Theodore's.&nbsp; His wife
shared his martyrdom.&nbsp; It is I who am escaped alone to tell
thee. But, nevertheless, this babe is an orphan of that same
day.&nbsp; Her father was the son of the pious Baron de Ribaumont,
the patron of your husband, and of myself in earlier days.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' exclaimed Noemi, startled.&nbsp; 'Then the poor young
mother--is she--can she be the lost Demoiselle de Nid de
Merle?'</p>

<p>'Is the thing known here?&nbsp; The will of Heaven be done; but
she can send to her husband's kindred in England.'</p>

<p>'She might rest safely enough, if others beside myself believed
in her being your son's widow,' said Noemi.&nbsp; 'Wherefore should
she not be thought so?'</p>

<p>'Poor Esperance!&nbsp; She would willingly have lent her name to
guard another,' said Master Gardon, thoughtfully; 'and, for the
sake of the child, my little lady may endure it.&nbsp; Ah! there is
the making of a faithful and noble woman in that poor young
thing.&nbsp; Bravely, patiently, cheerfully, hath she plodded this
weary way; and, verily, she hath grown like my own daughter to
me--as I never thought to love earthly thing again; and had this
been indeed my Theodore's child, I could hardly care for it
more.'</p>

<p>And as he related how he had fallen in with the forlorn Lady of
Ribaumont, and all that she had dared, done, and left undone for
the sake of her little daughter, good Noemi Laurent wept, and
agreed with him that a special providence must have directed them
to his care, and that some good work must await one who had been
carried through so much. His project was to remain here for a short
time, to visit the flock who had lost their pastor on the day of
the massacre, and to recruit his own strength; for he, too, had
suffered severely from the long travelling, and the exposure during
many nights, especially since all that was warm and sheltered had
been devoted to Eustacie.&nbsp; And after this he proposed to go to
La Rochelle, and make inquiries for a trusty messenger who could be
sent to England to seek out the family of the Baron de Ribaumont,
or, mayhap, a sufficient escort with whom the lady could travel;
though he had nearly made up his mind that he would not relinquish
the care of her until he had safely delivered her to her husband's
mother.</p>

<p>Health and life were very vigorous in Eustacie; and though at
first she had been completely worn out, a few days of comfort,
entire rest, and good nursing restored her.&nbsp; Noemi dressed her
much like herself, in a black gown, prim little white starched
ruff, and white cap,--a thorough Calvinist dress, and befitting a
minister's widow.&nbsp; Eustacie winced a little at hearing of the
character that had been fastened upon her; she disliked for her
child, still more than for herself, to take this <i>bourgeois</i>
name of Gardon; but there was no help for it, since, though he
chief personages of the town were Huguenot, there could be no
safety for her if the report were once allowed to arise that the
Baronne de Ribaumont had taken refuge there.</p>

<p>It was best that she should be as little noticed as possible;
nor, indeed, had good Noemi many visitors.&nbsp; The sad and
sorrowful woman had always shut herself up with her Bible and her
meditations, and sought no sympathy from her neighbours, nor
encourage gossip in her shop.&nbsp; In the first days, when
purchasers lingered to ask if it were true that Maitre Gardon had
brought his daughter-in-law and grandchild, her stern-faced, almost
grim answer, that <i>'la pauvre</i> was ill at ease,' silenced
them, and forced them to carry off their curiosity unsatisfied; but
it became less easy to arrange when Eustacie herself was on foot
again--refreshed, active, and with an irrepressible spring of
energy and eagerness that could hardly be caged down in the Widow
Laurent's tiny rooms.&nbsp; Poor child, had she not been ill and
prostrate at first, and fastened herself on the tender side of the
good woman's heart by the sweetness of an unselfish and buoyant
nature in illness, Noemi could hardly have endured such an inmate,
not even half a Huguenot, full of little Catholic observances like
second nature to her; listening indeed to the Bible for the short
time, but always, when it was expounded, either asleep, or finding
some amusement indispensable for her baby; eager for the least
variety, and above all spoilt by Maitre Gardon to a degree
absolutely perplexing to the grave woman.</p>

<p>He would not bid her lay aside the observances that, to Noemi,
seemed almost worship of the beast.&nbsp; He rather reverted to the
piety which originated them; and argued with his old friend that it
was better to build than to destroy, and that, before the fabric of
truth, superstition would crumble away of itself.&nbsp; The little
he taught her sounded to Noemi's puzzled ears mere Christianity
instead of controversial Calvinism.&nbsp; And, moreover, he never
blamed her for wicked worldliness when she yawned; but even devised
opportunities for taking her out for a walk, to see as much life as
might be on a market-day.&nbsp; He could certainly not forget--as
much as would have been prudent--that she was a high-born lady; and
even seemed taken aback when he found her with her sleeves turned
up over her shapely-delicate arms, and a thick apron before her,
with her hands in Veuve Laurent's flour, showing her some of those
special mysterious arts of confectionery in which she had been
initiated by Soeur Bernardine, when, not three years ago, she had
been the pet of the convent at Bellaise.&nbsp; At first it was half
sport and the desire of occupation, but the produce of her
manipulations was so excellent as to excite quite a sensation in La
Sablerie, and the echevins and baillis sent in quite considerable
orders for the cakes and patties of Maitre Gardon's Paris-bred
daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>Maitre Gardon hesitated.&nbsp; Noemi Laurent told him she cared
little for the gain--Heaven knew it was nothing to her--but that
she thought it wrong and inconsistent in him to wish to spare the
poor child's pride, which was unchristian enough already.&nbsp;
'Nay,' he said sadly, 'mortifications from without do little to
tame pride; nor did I mean to bring her here that she should turn
cook and confectioner to pamper the appetite of Baillis La
Grasse.'</p>

<p>But Eustacie's first view was a bright pleasure in the triumph
of her skill; and when her considerate guardian endeavoured to
impress on her that there was no necessity for vexing herself with
the task, she turned round on him with the exclamation, 'Nay, dear
father, do you not see it is my great satisfaction to be able to do
something for our good hostess, so that my daughter and I be not a
burden to her?'</p>

<p>'Well spoken, my Lady,' said the pastor; 'there is real nobility
in that way of thinking.&nbsp; Yet, remember, Noemi is not without
means; she feels not the burden.&nbsp; And the flock contribute
enough for the shepherd's support, and yours likewise.'</p>

<p>'Then let her give it to the poor creatures who so often come in
begging, and saying they have been burned out of house and home by
one party or the other,' said Eustacie.&nbsp; 'Let me have my way,
dear sir; Soeur Bernadine always said I should be a prime <i>
menagere</i>.&nbsp; I like it so much.'</p>

<p>And Madame de Ribaumont mixed sugar and dough, and twisted
quaint shapes, and felt important and almost light-hearted, and
sang over her work and over her child songs that were not always
Marot's psalms; and that gave the more umbrage to Noemi, because
she feared that Maitre Gardon actually like to hear them, though,
should their echo reach the street, why it would be a peril, and
still worse, a horrible scandal that out of that sober, afflicted
household should proceed profane tunes such as court ladies
sang.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.&nbsp; THE ABBE.</h3>

<p>By the day and night her sorrows fall</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where miscreant hands and rude</p>

<p>Have stained her pure, ethereal pall</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a martyr's blood.</p>

<p>And yearns not her maternal heart</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear their secret sighs,</p>

<p>Upon whose doubting way apart</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bewildering shadows rise?--KEBLE</p>

<p>It was in the summer twilight that Eustacie, sitting on the
doorstep between the two rooms, with her baby on her knees, was
dreamily humming to her a tune, without even words, but one that
she loved, because she had first learnt to sing it with Berenger
and his friend Sidney to the lute of the latter; and its notes
always brought before her eyes the woods of Montpipeau.&nbsp; Then
it was that, low and soft as was the voice, that befell which Noemi
had feared: a worn, ragged-looking young man, who had been
bargaining at the door for a morsel of bread in exchange for a
handkerchief, started at the sound, and moved so as to like into
the house.</p>

<p>Noemi was at the moment not attending, being absorbed in the
study of the handkerchief, which was of such fine, delicate texture
that an idea of its having been stolen possessed her; and she
sought the corner where, as she expected, a coat-of-arms was
embroidered.&nbsp; Just as she was looking up to demand
explanation, the stranger, with a sudden cry of 'Good heavens, it
is she!' pushed past her into the house, and falling on his knee
before Eustacie, exclaimed, 'O Lady, Lady, is it thus that I see
you?'</p>

<p>Eustacie had started up in dismay, crying out, 'Ah! M. l'Abbe,
as you are a gentleman, betray me not.&nbsp; Oh! have they sent you
to find me?&nbsp; Have pity on us!&nbsp; You loved my husband!'</p>

<p>'You have nothing to fear from me, Lady,' said the young man,
still kneeling; 'if you are indeed a distressed fugitive--so am
I.&nbsp; If you have shelter and friends--I have none.'</p>

<p>'Is it indeed so?' said Eustacie, wistfully, yet scarce
reassured.&nbsp; 'You are truly not come from my uncle.&nbsp;
Indeed, Monsieur, I would not doubt you, but you see I have so much
at stake.&nbsp; I have my little one here, and they mean so cruelly
by her.'</p>

<p>'Madame, I swear by the honour of a nobleman--nay, by all that
is sacred--that I know nothing of your uncle.&nbsp; I have been a
wanderer for many weeks past; proscribed and hunted down because I
wished to seek into the truth.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Eustacie, with a sound of relief, and of apology,
'pardon me, sir; indeed, I know you were good.&nbsp; You loved my
husband;' and she reached out her hand to raise him, when he kissed
it reverently.&nbsp; Little <i>bourgeoise</i> and worn mendicant as
they were in dress, the air of the Louvre breathed round
them;&nbsp; and there was all its grace and dignity as the lady
turned round to her astonished hosts, saying, 'Good sir, kind
mother, this gentleman is, indeed, what you took me for, a fugitive
for the truth.&nbsp; Permit me to present to you, Monsieur l'Abbe
de Mericour--at least, so he was, when last I had the honour to see
him.'</p>

<p>The last time HE had seen her, poor Eustacie had been incapable
of seeing anything save that bloody pool at the foot of the
stairs.</p>

<p>Mericour now turned and explained.&nbsp; 'Good friends,' he said
courteously, but with the <i>fierete</i> of the noble not quite out
of his tone, 'I beg your grace.&nbsp; I would not have used so
little ceremony, if I had not been out of myself at recognizing a
voice and a tune that could belong to none but Madame---'</p>

<p>'Sit down, sir,' said Noemi, a little coldly and stiffly--for
Mericour was a terrible name to Huguenots ears; 'a true friend to
this lady must needs be welcome, above all if he comes in Heaven's
name.'</p>

<p>'Sit down and eat, sir,' added Gardon, much more heartily; 'and
forgive us for not having been more hospitable--but the times have
taught us to be cautious, and in that lady we have a precious
charge.&nbsp; Rest; for you look both weary and hungry.'</p>

<p>Eustacie added an invitation, understanding that he would not
sit without her permission, and then, as he dropped into a chair,
she exclaimed, 'Ah! sir, you are faint, but you are famished.'</p>

<p>'It will pass,' he said; 'I have not eaten to-day.'</p>

<p>Instantly a meal was set before him, and ere long he revived;
and as the shutters were closed, and shelter for the night promised
to him by a Huguenot family lodging in the same house, he began to
answer Eustacie's anxious questions, as well as to learn from her
in return what had brought her into her present situation.</p>

<p>Then it was that she recollected that it had been he who, at her
cousin Diane's call, had seized her when she was rushing out of the
palace in her first frenzy of grief, and had carried her back to
the women's apartments.</p>

<p>'It was that day which brought me here,' he said.</p>

<p>And he told how, bred up in his own distant province, by a pious
and excellent tutor, he had devoutly believed in the extreme
wickedness of the Reformers; but in his seclusion he had been
trained to such purity of faith and morals, that, when his brother
summoned him to court to solicit a benefice, he had been appalled
at the aspect of vice, and had, at the same time, been struck by
the pure lives of the Huguenots; for truly, as things then were at
the French court, crime seemed to have arrayed itself on the side
of the orthodox party, all virtue on that of the schismatics.</p>

<p>De Mericour consulted spiritual advisers, who told him that none
but Catholics could be truly holy, and that what he admired were
merely heathen virtues that the devil permitted the Huguenots to
display in order to delude the unwary.&nbsp; With this explanation
he had striven to be satisfied, though eyes unblended by guilt and
a pure heart continued to be revolted at the practices which his
Church, scared at the evil times, and forgetful of her own true
strength, left undenounced in her partisans.&nbsp; And the more
that the Huguenot gentlemen thronged the court, and the young Abbe
was thrown into intercourse with them, and the more he perplexed
himself how the truth, the faith, the uprightness, the forbearance,
the purity that they evinced could indeed be wanting in the zeal
that made them acceptable.&nbsp; Then came the frightful morning
when carnage reigned in every street, and the men who had been
treated as favourite boon companions were hunted down like wild
beasts in every street.&nbsp; He had endeavoured to save life, but
would have speedily been slaughtered himself except for his
soutane; and in all good faith he had hurried to the Louvre, to
inform royalty of the horrors that, as he thought, a fanatic
passion was causing the populace to commit.</p>

<p>He found the palace become shambles--the King himself, wrought
up to frenzy, firing on the fugitives.&nbsp; And the next day,
while his brain still seemed frozen with horror, he was called on
to join in the procession of thanksgiving for the King's
deliverance from a dangerous plot.&nbsp; Surely, if the plot were
genuine, he thought, the procession should have savoured of penance
and humiliation rather than of barbarous exultation!&nbsp; Yet
these might be only the individual crimes of the Queen-mother, and
of the Guises seeking to mask themselves under the semblance of
zeal; and the infallible head of the visible Church would disown
the slaughter, and cast it from the Church with loathing as a
blood-stained garment.&nbsp; Behold, Rome was full of rejoicing,
and sent sanction and commendation of the pious zeal of the
King!&nbsp; Had the voice of Holy Church become indeed as the voice
of the bloodhound?&nbsp; Was this indeed her call?</p>

<p>The young man, whose life from infancy had been marked out for
the service of the Church--so destined by his parents as securing a
wealthy provision for a younger son, but educated by his good tutor
with more real sense of his obligations--felt the question in its
full import.&nbsp; He was under no vows; he had, indeed, received
the tonsure, but was otherwise unpledged, and he was bent on
proving all things.&nbsp; The gaieties in which he had at first
mingled had become abhorrent to him, and he studied with the
earnestness of a newly-awakened mind in search of true light.&nbsp;
The very face of study and inquiry, in one of such a family as that
of his brother the Duke de Mericour, was enough to excite suspicion
of Huguenot inclinations.&nbsp; The elder brother tried to quash
the folly of the younger, by insisting on his sharing the
debaucheries which, whether as priest or monk, or simply as
Christian man, it would be his duty to abjure; and at length, by
way of bringing things to a test, insisted on his making one of a
party who were about to break up and destroy a Huguenot
assembly.&nbsp; Unable, in his present mood, to endure the thought
of further cruelty, the young Abbe fled, gave secret warning to the
endangered congregation, and hastened to the old castle in
Brittany, where he had been brought up, to pour out his
perplexities, and seek the counsel of the good old chaplain who had
educated him.&nbsp; Whether the kind, learned, simple-hearted tutor
could have settled his mind, he had no time to discover, for he had
scarcely unfolded his troubles before warnings came down that he
had better secure himself--his brother, as head of the family, had
obtained the royal assent to the imprisonment of the rebellious
junior, so as to bring him to a better mind, and cure him of the
Huguenot inclinations, which in the poor lad were simply
undeveloped.&nbsp; But in all the Catholic eyes he was a tainted
man, and his almost inevitable course was to take refuge with some
Huguenot relations.&nbsp; There he was eagerly welcome; instruction
was poured in on him; but as he showed a disposition to inquire and
examine, and needed time to look into what they taught him, as one
who feared to break his link with the Church, and still longed to
find her blameless and glorious, the righteous nation that keepeth
the truth, they turned on him and regarded him as a traitor and a
spy, who had come among them on false pretences.</p>

<p>All the poor lad wanted was time to think, time to examine, time
to consult authorities, living and dead.&nbsp; The Catholics called
this treason to the Church, the Huguenots called it halting between
two opinions; and between them he was a proscribed, distrusted
vagabond, branded on one side as a recreant, and on the other as a
traitor.&nbsp; He had asked for a few months of quiet, and where
could they be had?&nbsp; His grand-mother had been the daughter of
a Scottish nobleman in the French service, and he had once seen a
nephew of hers who had come to Paris during the time of Queen
Mary's residence there.&nbsp; He imagined that if he were once out
of this distracted land of France, he might find respite for study,
for which he longed; and utterly ignorant of the real state of
Scotland, he had determined to make his way to his kindred there;
and he had struggled on the way to La Rochelle, cheated out of the
small remains of his money, selling his last jewels and all the
clothing that was not indispensable, and becoming so utterly unable
to pay his passage to England, that he could only trust to
Providence to find him some means of reaching his present goal.</p>

<p>He had been listened to with kindness, and a sympathy such as M.
Gardon's large mind enable him to bestow, where his brethren had
been incapable of comprehending that a man could sincerely doubt
between them and Rome.&nbsp; When the history was finished,
Eustacie exclaimed, turning to Maitre Gardon, 'Ah! sir, is not this
just what we sought?&nbsp; If this gentleman would but convey a
letter to my mother-in-law---'</p>

<p>M. Gardon smiled.&nbsp; 'Scotland and England are by no means
the same place, Lady,' he said.</p>

<p>'Whatever this lady would command, wherever she would send me, I
am at her service,' cried the Abbe, fervently.</p>

<p>And, after a little further debate, it was decided that it might
really be the best course, for him as for Madame de Ribaumont, to
become the bearer of a letter and token from her, entreating her
mother-in-law to notify her pleasure whether she should bring her
child to England.&nbsp; She had means enough to advance a
sufficient sum to pay Mericour's passage, and he accepted it most
punctiliously as a loan, intending, so soon as her despatches were
ready, to go on to La Rochelle, and make inquiry for a ship.</p>

<p>Chance, however, seemed unusually propitious, for the next day
there was an apparition in the streets of La Sablerie of four or
five weather-beaten, rollicking-looking men, their dress profusely
adorned with ribbons, and their language full of strange
oaths.&nbsp; They were well known at La Sablerie as sailors
belonging to a ship of the fleet of the Count de Montgomery, the
unfortunate knight whose lance had caused the death of King Henry
II., and who, proscribed by the mortal hatred of Catherine de
Medicis, had become the admiral of a&nbsp; piratical fleet in the
Calvinist interest, so far winked at the Queen Elizabeth that it
had its head-quarters in the Channel Islands, and thence was a most
formidable foe to merchant vessels on the northern and eastern
coasts of France; and often indulged in descents on the coast, when
the sailors--being in general the scum of the nation--were apt to
comport themselves more like American buccaneers than like
champions of any form of religion.</p>

<p>La Sablerie was a Huguenot town, so they used no violence, but
only swaggered about, demanding from Bailli La Grasse, in the name
of their gallant Captain Latouche, contributions and provisions,
and giving him to understand that if he did not comply to the
uttermost it should be the worse for him.&nbsp; Their ship, it
appeared, had been forced to put into the harbour, about two miles
off, and Maitre Gardon and the young Abbe decided on walking
thither to see it, and to have an interview with the captain, so as
to secure a passage for Mericour at least.&nbsp; Indeed Maitre
Gardon had, in consultation with Eustacie, resolved, if he found
things suitable, to arrange for their all going together.&nbsp; She
would be far safer out of France; and, although the Abbe alone
could not have escorted her, yet Maitre Gardon would gladly have
secured for her the additional protection of a young, strong, and
spirited man; and Eustacie, who was no scribe, was absolutely
relieved to have the voyage set before her as an alternative to the
dreadful operation of composing a letter to the <i>belle-mere</i>,
whom she had not seen since she had been seven years old, and of
whose present English name she had the most indistinct ideas.</p>

<p>However, the first sight of the ship overthrew all such
ideas.&nbsp; It was a wretched single-decked vessel, carrying far
more sail than experienced nautical eyes would have deemed safe,
and with no accommodation fit for a woman and child, even had the
aspect of captain or crew been more satisfactory--for the ruffianly
appearance and language of the former fully rivaled that of his
sailors.&nbsp; It would have been mere madness to think of trusting
the lady in such hands; and, without a word to each other, Gardon
and Mericour resolved to give no hint even that she and her jewels
were in La Sablerie.&nbsp; Mericour, however, made his bargain with
the captain, who understood to transport him as far as Guernsey,
whence he might easily make his way to Dorsetshire, where M. Gardon
knew that Berenger's English home had been.</p>

<p>So Eustacie, with no small trouble and consideration, indited
her letter--telling of her escape, the birth of her daughter, the
dangers that threatened her child--and begging that its
grand-mother would give it a safe home in England, and love it for
the sake of its father.&nbsp; An answer would find her at the Widow
Noemi Laurent's, Rue des Trois Fees, La Sablerie.&nbsp; She could
not bring herself to speak of the name of Eserance Gardon which had
been saddled upon her; and even M. de Mericour remained in
ignorance of her bearing this disguise.&nbsp; She recommended him
to the kindness of her mother-in-law; and M. Gardon added another
letter to the lady, on behalf of the charge to whom he promised to
devote himself until he should see them safe in friendly
hands.&nbsp; Both letters were addressed, as best they might be,
between Eustacie's dim comprehension of the word Thistlewood, and
M. Gardon's notion of spelling.&nbsp; 'Jadis, Baronne de Ribaumont'
was the securest part of the direction.</p>

<p>And for a token, Eustacie looked over her jewels to find one
that would serve for a token; but the only ones she knew would be
recognized, were the brooch that had fastened the plume in
Berenger's bloody cap, and the chaplet of pearls.&nbsp; To part
with the first, or to risk the second in the pirate-ship, was
impossible, but Eustacie at last decided upon detaching the
pear-shaped pearl which was nearest the clasp, and which was so
remarkable in form and tint that there was no doubt of its being
well known.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.&nbsp; UNDER THE WALNUT-TREE</h3>

<p>Mistress Jean was making the elder-flower wine--</p>

<p>'And what brings the Laird at sic a like time?'</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LADY NAIRN, THE LAIRD OF COCKPEN</p>

<p>Summer was nearly ended, and Lucy Thistlewood was presiding in
the great kitchen of the Manor-house, standing under the latticed
window near the large oak-table, a white apron over her dress,
presiding over the collecting of elder-berries for the brew of
household-wine for the winter.&nbsp; The maids stood round her with
an array of beechen bowls or red and yellow crocks, while
barefooted, bareheaded children came thronging in with rush or
wicker baskets of the crimson fruit, which the maids poured in
sanguine cascades into their earthenware; and Lucy requited with
substantial slices of bread and cheese, and stout homely garment
mostly of her own sewing.</p>

<p>Lucy was altogether an inmate of her father's house.&nbsp; She
had not even been at Hurst Walwyn for many months; for her
step-mother's reiterated hopes that Berenger would make her his
consolation for all he had suffered from his French spouse rendered
it impossible to her to meet him with sisterly unconsciousness; and
she therefore kept out of the way, and made herself so useful at
home, that Dame Annora only wondered how it had been possible to
spare her so long, and always wound up her praises by saying, that
Berenger would learn in time how lucky he had been to lose the
French puppet, and win the good English housewife.</p>

<p>If only tidings would have come that the puppet was safe
married.&nbsp; That was the crisis which all the family desired yet
feared for Berenger, since nothing else they saw would so detach
his thoughts from the past as the leave him free to begin life
again.&nbsp; The relapse brought on by the cruel reply to Osbert's
message had been very formidable: he was long insensible or
delirious and then came a state of annihilated thought, then of
frightfully sensitive organs, when light, sound, movement, or scent
were alike agony; and when he slowly revived, it was with such
sunken spirits, that his silence was as much from depression as
from difficulty of speech.&nbsp; His brain was weak, his limbs
feeble, the wound in his mouth never painless; and all this
necessarily added to his listless indifference and weariness, as
though all youthful hope and pleasure were extinct in him.&nbsp; He
had ceased to refer to the past.&nbsp; Perhaps he had thought it
over, and seen that the deferred escape, the request for the
pearls, the tryst at the palace, and detention from the king's
chamber, made an uglier case against Eustacie than he could endure
to own even to himself.&nbsp; If his heart trusted, his mind could
not argue out her defence, and his tongue would not serve him for
discussion with his grandfather, the only person who could act for
him.&nbsp; Perhaps the stunned condition of his mind made the
suspense just within the bounds of endurance, while trust in his
wife's innocence rendered his inability to come to her aid
well-nigh intolerable; and doubt of her seemed both profanity and
misery unspeakable.&nbsp; He could do nothing.&nbsp; He had shot
his only shaft by sending Landry Osbert, and had found that to
endeavour to induce his grandfather to use further measures was
worse than useless, and was treated as mere infatuation.&nbsp; He
knew that all he had to do was to endeavour for what patience he
could win from Cecily's sweet influence and guidance, and to wait
till either certainty should come--that dreadful, miserable
certainty that all looked for, and his very helplessness might be
bringing about--or till he should regain strength to be again
effective.</p>

<p>And miserably slow work was this recovery.&nbsp; No one had
surgical skill to deal with so severe a wound as that which
Narcisse had inflicted; and the daily pain and inconvenience it
caused led to innumerable drawbacks that often--even after he had
come as far as the garden--brought him back to his bed in a dark
room, to blood-letting, and to speechlessness.&nbsp; No one knew
much of his mind--</p>

<p>Cecily perhaps the most; and next to her, Philip--who, from the
time he had been admitted to his step-brother's presence, had been
most assiduous in tending him--seemed to understand his least sign,
and to lay aside all his boisterous roughness in his eager desire
to do him service.&nbsp; The lads had loved each other from the
moment they had met as children, but never so apparently as now,
when all the rude horse-play of healthy youths was over--and one
was dependent, the other considerate.&nbsp; And if Berenger had
made on one else believe in Eustacie, he had taught Philip to view
her as the 'Queen's men' viewed Mary of Scotland.&nbsp; Philip had
told Lucy the rough but wholesome truth, that 'Mother talks mere
folly.&nbsp; Eustacie is no more to be spoken of with you than a
pheasant with old brown Partlet; and Berry waits but to be well to
bring her off from all her foes.&nbsp; And I'll go with him.'</p>

<p>It was on Philip's arm that Berenger first crept round the
bowling-green, and with Philip at his rein that he first endured to
ride along the avenue on Lord Walwyn's smooth-paced palfrey; and it
was Philip who interrupted Lucy's household cares by rushing in and
shouting, 'Sister, here! I have wiled him to ride over the down,
and he is sitting under the walnut-tree quite spent, and the three
little wenches are standing in a row, weeping like so many little
mermaids.&nbsp; Come, I say!'</p>

<p>Lucy at once followed him through the house, through the deep
porch to the court, which was shaded by a noble walnut-tree, where
Sir Marmaduke loved to sit among his dogs.&nbsp; There not sat
Berenger, resting against the trunk, overcome by the heat and
exertion of his ride.&nbsp; His cloak and hat lay on the ground;
the dogs fawned round him, eager for the wonted caress, and his
three little sisters stood a little aloof, clinging to one another
and crying piteously.</p>

<p>It was their first sight of him; and it seemed to them as if he
were behind a frightful mask.&nbsp; Even Lucy was not without a
sensation of the kind, of this effect in the change from the
girlish, rosy complexion to extreme paleness, on which was visible,
in ghastly red and purple, the great scar left by Narcisse, from
the temple on the one side to the ear on the other.</p>

<p>The far more serious would on the cheek was covered with a black
patch, and the hair had almost entirely disappeared from the head,
only a few light brown locks still hanging round the neck and
temples, so that the bald brow gave a strange look of age; and the
disfigurement was terrible, enhanced as it was by the wasting
effect of nearly a year of sickness.&nbsp; Lucy was so much
shocked, that she could hardly steady her voice to chide the
children for not giving a better welcome to their brother.&nbsp;
They would have clung round her, but she shook them off, and sent
Annora in haste for her mother's fan; while Philip arriving with a
slice of diet-bread and a cup of sack, the one fanned him, and the
other fed him with morsels of the cake soaked in the wine, till he
revived, looked up with eyes that were unchanged, and thanked them
with a few faltering words, scarcely intelligible to Lucy.&nbsp;
The little girls came nearer, and curiously regarded him but when
he held out his hand to his favourite Dolly, she shrank back in
reluctance.</p>

<p>'Do not chide her,' he said wearily.&nbsp; 'May she never become
used to such marks!'</p>

<p>'What, would you have her live among cowards?'&nbsp; exclaimed
Philip; but Berenger, instead of answering, looked up at the front
of the house, one of those fine Tudor facades that seem all carved
timber and glass lattice, and asked, so abruptly that Lucy doubted
whether she heard him alright,--'How many windows are there in this
front?'</p>

<p>'I never counted,' said Philip.</p>

<p>'I have,' said Annora; 'there are seven and thirty, besides the
two little ones in the porch.'</p>

<p>'None shall make them afraid,' he muttered.&nbsp; 'Who would
dare build such a defenceless house over yonder?'--pointing
south.</p>

<p>'Our hearts are guarded now,' said Philip, proudly.&nbsp;
Berenger half smiled, as he was wont to do when he meant more than
he could conveniently utter, and presently he asked, in the same
languid, musing tone, 'Lucy, were you ever really affrighted?'</p>

<p>Lucy questioned whether he could be really in his right mind, as
if the bewilderment of his brain was again returning; and while she
paused, Annora exclaimed, 'Yes, when we were gathering cowslips,
and the brindled cow ran at us, and Lucy could not run because she
had Dolly in her arm.&nbsp; Oh! we were frightened then, till you
came, brother.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' added Bessie; 'and last winter too, when the owl shrieked
at the window---'</p>

<p>'And,' added Berenger, 'sister, what was your greatest time of
revelry?'</p>

<p>Annora again put in her word.&nbsp; 'I know, brother; you
remember the fair-day, when my Lady Grandame was angered because
you and Lucy went on dancing when we and all then gentry had
ceased.&nbsp; And when Lucy said she had not seen that you were
left alone, Aunt Cecily said it was because the eyes of discretion
were lacking.'</p>

<p>'Oh, the Christmas feast was far grander,' said Bessie. 'Then
Lucy had her first satin farthingale, and three gallants, besides
my brother, wanted to dance with her.'</p>

<p>Blushing deeply, Lucy tried to hush the little ones, much
perplexed by the questions, and confused by the answers.&nbsp;
Could he be contrasting the life where a vicious cow had been the
most alarming object, a greensward dance with a step-brother the
greatest gaiety, dye of the elder juice the deepest stain, with the
temptations and perils that had beset one equally young?&nbsp;
Resting his head on his hand, his elbow on his knee, he seemed to
be musing in a reverie that he could hardly brook, as his young
brow was knitted by care and despondency.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the sounds in the village rose from the quiet sleepy
summer hum into a fierce yell of derisive vituperation, causing
Philip at once to leap up, and run across the court to the
entrance-gate, while Lucy called after him some vain sisterly
warning against mingling in a fray.</p>

<p>It seemed as if his interposition had a good effect, for the
uproar lulled almost as soon as he had hurried to the scene of
action; and presently he reappeared, eager and breathless.&nbsp; 'I
told them to bring him up here,' he said; 'they would have flogged
him at the cart's-tail, the rogues, just because my father is out
of the way.&nbsp; I could not make out his jargon, but you can,
brother; and make that rascal Spinks let him go.'</p>

<p>'What should I have to do with it?' said Berenger, shrinking
from the sudden exposure of his scarred face and maimed
speech.&nbsp; 'I am no magistrate.'</p>

<p>'But you can understand him; he is French, the poor rogue
something abut a letter, and wanting to ask his way.&nbsp; Ah! I
thought that would touch you, and it will cost you little pains,
and slouching it over his face, rose, and, leaning upon Annora's
shoulder, stepped forward, just as the big burly
blacksmith-constable and small shrivelled cobbler advanced,
dragging along, by a cord round the wrists, a slight figure with a
red woollen sailor's shirt, ragged black hosen, bare head, and
almost bare feet.</p>

<p>Doffing their caps, the men began an awkward salutation to the
young Lord on his recovery, but he only touched his beaver in
return, and demanded, 'How now! what have you bound him for?'</p>

<p>'You see, my Lord,' began the constable, 'there have been a sort
of vagrants of late, and I'll be bound' twas no four-legged fox as
took Gaffer Shepherd's lamb.'</p>

<p>The peroration was broken off, for with a start as if he had
been shot, Berenger cried aloud, 'Mericour! the Abbe!'</p>

<p>'Ah, Monsieur, if you know me,' cried the young man, raising his
head, 'free me from this shame--aid me in my mission!'</p>

<p>'Loose him, fellows,' shouted Berenger; 'Philip, a knife--Lucy,
those scissors.'</p>

<p>'Tis my duty, my Lord,' said Spinks, gruffly.&nbsp; 'All
vagabonds to be apprehended and flogged at the cart's-tail, by her
Grace's special commands.&nbsp; How is it to be answered to his
Honour, Sir Marmaduke?'</p>

<p>'Oaf!' cried Philip, 'you durst not have used such violence had
my father been at home!&nbsp; Don't you see my brother knows
him?'</p>

<p>With hands trembling with haste, Berenger had seized the
scissors that, house-wife like, hung at Lucy's waist, and was
cutting the rope, exclaiming in French, 'Pardon, pardon, friend,
for so shameful a reception.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' was the reply, without a sign of recognition, 'if,
indeed, you know my name, I entreat you to direct me to the chateau
of Le Sieur Tistefote, whose lady was once Baronne de
Ribaumont.'</p>

<p>'My mother!&nbsp; Ah, my friend, my friend! what would you?' he
cried in a tone of tremulous hope and fear, laying one hand on
Mericour's shoulder, and about to embrace him.</p>

<p>Mericour retreated from him; but the high-spirited young man
crossed his arms on his breast, and gazing at the group with
indignant scorn, made answer, 'My message is from her who deems
herself a widow, to the mother of the husband whom she little
imagines to be not only alive, but consoled.'</p>

<p>'Faithful! Faithful!' burst out Berenger, with a wild, exultant,
strangely-ringing shout.&nbsp; 'Woe, woe to those who would have
had me doubt her!&nbsp; Philip--Lucy--hear!&nbsp; Her truth is
clear to all the world!'&nbsp; Then changing back again to French,
'Ten thousand blessings on you, Mericour!&nbsp; You have seen
her!&nbsp; Where--how?'</p>

<p>Mericour still spoke with frigid politeness.&nbsp; 'I had the
honour to part with Madame la Baronne de Ribaumont in the town of
La Sablerie, among humble, Huguenot guardians, to whom she had
fled, to save her infant's life--when no aid came.'</p>

<p>He was obliged to break off, for Berenger, stunned by the sudden
rush of emotion, reeled as he stood, and would have fallen but for
the prompt support of Lucy, who was near enough to guide him back
to rest upon the bench, saying resentfully in French as she did so,
'My brother is still very ill.&nbsp; I pray you, sir, have a
care.'</p>

<p>She had not half understood the rapid words of the two young
men, Philip comprehended them far less, and the constable and his
crew of course not at all; and Spinks pushed forward among the
group as he saw Berenger sink back on the bench; and once more
collaring his prisoner, exclaimed almost angrily to Philip, 'There
now, sir, you've had enough of the vagabond.&nbsp; We'll keep him
tight ere he bewitches any more of you.'</p>

<p>This rude interference proved an instant restorative.&nbsp;
Berenger sprang up at once, and seizing Spink's arm, exclaimed,
'Hands off, fellow!&nbsp; This is my friend--a gentleman.&nbsp; He
brings me tidings of infinite gladness.&nbsp; Who insults him,
insults me.'</p>

<p>Spinks scarcely withdrew his hand from Mericour's neck; and
scowling, said, 'Very odd gentleman--very queer tidings, Master
Berenger, to fell you like an ox.&nbsp; I must be answerable for
the fellow till his Honour comes.'</p>

<p>'Ah!&nbsp; <i>Eh quoi</i>, wherefore not show the <i>
canaille</i> your sword?' said Mericour, impatiently.</p>

<p>'It may not be here, in England,' said Berenger (who fortunately
was not wearing his weapon).&nbsp; 'And in good time here comes my
step-father,' as the gate swung back, and Sir Marmaduke and Lady
Thistlewood rode through it, the former sending his voice far
before him to demand the meaning of the hurly-burly that filled his
court.</p>

<p>Philip was the first to spring to his rein, exclaiming, 'Father,
it is a Frenchman whom Spinks would have flogged at the
cart's-tail; but it seems he is a friend of Berenger's, and has
brought him tidings.&nbsp; I know not what--about his wife, I
believe--any way he is beside himself with joy.'</p>

<p>'Sir, your Honour,' shouted Spinks, again seizing Mericour, and
striving to drag him forward, 'I would know whether the law is to
be hindered from taking its course because my young Lord there is a
Frenchman and bewitched.'</p>

<p>'Ah,' shrieked Lady Thistlewood, 'I knew it.&nbsp; They will
have sent secret poison to finish him.&nbsp; Keep the fellow
safe.&nbsp; He will cast it in the air.'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay, my Lady,' said Spinks, 'there are plenty of us to
testify that he made my young Lord fall back as in a swoon, and
reel like one distraught.&nbsp; Pray Heaven it have not gone
further.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' exclaimed Berenger, who on the other side held his
friend's hand tight, 'this is a noble gentleman--the brother of the
Duke de Mericour.&nbsp; He has come at great risk to bring me
tidings of my dear and true wife.&nbsp; And not one word will these
demented rascals let me hear with their senseless clamour.'</p>

<p>'Berenger!&nbsp; You here, my boy!' exclaimed Sir Marmaduke,
more amazed by this than all the rest.</p>

<p>'He touches him--he holds him!&nbsp; Ah! will no one tear him
away?' screamed Lady Thistlewood.&nbsp; Nor would Spinks have been
slow in obeying her if Sir Marmaduke had not swung his substantial
form to the ground, and stepping up to the prisoner, rudely clawed
on one side by Spinks, and affectionately grasped on the other side
by Berenger, shouted--</p>

<p>'Let go, both!'&nbsp; does he speak English?&nbsp; Peace,
dame!&nbsp; If the lad be bewitched, it is the right way.&nbsp; He
looks like the other man.&nbsp; Eh, lad, what does your friend say
for himself?'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Berenger, interpreting Mericour's words as they were
spoken, 'he has been robbed and misused at sea by Montgomery's
pirate crews.&nbsp; He fled from court for the religion's sake; he
met her--my wife' (the voice was scarcely intelligible, so
tremulously was it spoken), 'in hiding among the Huguenots--he
brings a letter and a token from her to my mother.'</p>

<p>'Ha! And you know him?&nbsp; You avouch him to be what he
represents himself?'</p>

<p>'I knew him at court.&nbsp; I know him well.&nbsp; Father, make
these fellows cease their insults!&nbsp; I have heard nothing
yet.&nbsp; See here!' holding out what Mericour had put into his
hand; 'this you cannot doubt, mother.'</p>

<p>'Parted the pearls!&nbsp; Ah, the little minx!' cried the lady,
as she recognized the jewels.</p>

<p>'I thought he had been robbed?' added Sir Marmaduke.</p>

<p>'The gentleman doubts?' said Mericour, catching some of the
words.&nbsp; 'He should know that what is confided in a French
gentleman is only taken from him with his life.&nbsp; Much did I
lose; but the pearl I kept hidden in my mouth.'</p>

<p>Therewith he produced the letter.&nbsp; Lady Thistlewood
pronounced that no power on earth should induce her to open it, and
drew off herself and her little girls to a safe distance from the
secret poison she fancied it contained; while Sir Marmaduke was
rating the constables for taking advantage of his absence to
interpret the Queen's Vagrant Act in their own violent fashion;
ending, however, by sending them round to the buttery-hatch to
drink the young Lord's health.&nbsp; For the messenger, the good
knight heartily grasped his hand, welcoming him and thanking him
for having 'brought comfort to you poor lad's heart.'</p>

<p>But there Sir Marmaduke paused, doubting whether the letter had
indeed brought comfort; for Berenger, who had seized on it, when it
was refused by his mother, was sitting under the tree--turning away
indeed, but not able to conceal that his tears were gushing down
like rain.&nbsp; The anxious exclamation of his step-father roused
him at length, but he scarce found power or voice to utter, as he
thrust the letter into the knight's hand, 'Ah! see what has she not
suffered for me! me, whom you would have had believed her
faithless!'</p>

<p>He then grasped his friend's arm, and with him disappeared into
the house, leaving Sir Marmaduke holding the letter in a state of
the utmost bewilderment, and calling by turns on his wife and
daughter to read and explain it to him.</p>

<p>And as Lucy read the letter, with her mother could not yet
prevail on herself to touch, she felt at each word more grateful to
the good Aunt Cecily, whose influence had taught her always to view
Berenger as a brother, and not to condemn unheard the poor young
wife.&nbsp; If she had not been thus guarded, what distress might
not this day of joy to Berenger have brought to Lucy!&nbsp; Indeed,
Lady Thistlewood was vexed enough as it was, and ready to carry her
incredulity to the most inconsistent lengths.&nbsp; 'It was all a
trick for getting the poor boy back, that they might make an end of
him altogether.&nbsp; Tell her they thought him
dead.--'Tilley-valley!&nbsp; It was a mere attempt on her own
good-nature, to get a little French impostor on her hands.&nbsp;
Let Sir Duke look well to it, and take care that her poor boy was
not decoyed among them.&nbsp; The Frenchman might be cutting his
throat at that moment!&nbsp; Where was he?&nbsp; Had Sir Duke been
so lost as to let them out of sight together?&nbsp; No one had
either pity or prudence now that her poor father was gone;' and she
began to weep.</p>

<p>'No great fear on that score, dame,' laughed the knight.&nbsp;
'Did you not hear the lad shouting for "Phil, Phil!" almost in a
voice like old times?&nbsp; It does one good to hear it.'</p>

<p>Just at twilight, Berenger came down the steps, conducting a
graceful gentleman in black, to whom Lady Thistlewood's instinct
impelled her to make a low courtesy, before Berenger had said,
'Madam, allow me to present to you my friend, the Abbe de
Mericour.'</p>

<p>'Is it the same?' whispered Bessie to Annora.&nbsp; 'Surely he
is translated!'</p>

<p>'Only into Philip's old mourning suit.&nbsp; I know it by the
stain on the knee.</p>

<p>'Then it is translated too.&nbsp; Never did it look so well on
Philip!&nbsp; See, our mother is quite gracious to him; she speaks
to him as though he were some noble visitor to my Lord.'</p>

<p>Therewith Sir Marmaduke came forward, shook Mericour with all
his might by the hand, shouted to him his hearty thanks for the
good he had done his poor lad and assured him of a welcome from the
very bottom of his heart.&nbsp; The good knight would fain have
kept both Berenger and his friend at the Manor, but Berenger was
far too impatient to carry home his joy, and only begged the loan
of a horse for Mericour.&nbsp; For himself, he felt as if fatigue
or dejection would never touch him again, and he kissed his mother
and his sisters, including Lucy, all round, with an effusion of
delight.</p>

<p>'Is that indeed your step-father?' said Mericour, as they rode
away together.&nbsp; 'And the young man, is he your
half-brother?'</p>

<p>'Brother wholly in dear love,' said Berenger; 'no blood
relation.&nbsp; The little girls are my mother's children.'</p>

<p>'Ah! so large a family all one?&nbsp; All at home?&nbsp; None in
convents?'</p>

<p>'We have no convents.'</p>

<p>'Ah, no. but all at home!&nbsp; All at peace!&nbsp; This is a
strange place, your England.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII. &nbsp;DEPARTURE</h3>

<p>It is my mistress!</p>

<p>Since she is living, let the time run on</p>

<p>To good or bad.--CYMBELINE</p>

<p>Mericour found the welcome at Hurst Walwyn kindly and more
polished than that at Combe Manor.&nbsp; He was more readily
understood, and found himself at his natural element.&nbsp; Lord
Walwyn, in especial, took much notice of him, and conversed with
him long and earnestly; while Berenger, too happy and too weary to
exert himself to say many words, sat as near Cecily as he could,
treating her as though she, who had never contradicted in his trust
in Eustacie, were the only person who could worthily share his
infinite relief, peace, and thankfulness.</p>

<p>Lord Walwyn said scarcely anything to his grandson that night,
only when Berenger, as usual, bent his knee to ask his blessing on
parting for the night, he said, gravely, 'Son, I am glad of your
joy; I fear me you have somewhat to pardon your grandsire.&nbsp;
Come to my library so soon as morning prayers be over; we will
speak then.&nbsp; Not now, my dear lad,' he added, as Berenger,
with tears in his eyes, kissed his hand, and would have begun; 'you
are too much worn and spent to make my dear ears hear.&nbsp; Sleep,
and take my blessing with you.'</p>

<p>It was a delight to see the young face freed from the haggard,
dejected expression that had been sadder than the outward wound;
and yet it was so questionable how far the French connection was
acceptable to the family, that when Berenger requested Mr. Adderley
to make mention of the mercy vouchsafed to him in the morning
devotions, the chaplain bowed, indeed, but took care to ascertain
that his so doing would be agreeable to my Lord and my Lady.</p>

<p>He found that if Lady Walwyn was still inclined to regret that
the Frenchwoman was so entirely a wife, and thought Berenger had
been very hasty and imprudent, yet that the old Lord was chiefly
distressed at the cruel injustice he had so long been doing this
poor youth thing.&nbsp; A strong sense of justice, and long habit
of dignified self-restraint, alone prevented Lord Walwyn from
severely censuring Mr. Adderley for misrepresentations; but the old
nobleman recollected that Walsingham had been in the same story,
and was too upright to visit his own vexation on the
honestly-mistaken tutor.</p>

<p>However, when Berenger made his appearance in the study, looking
as if not one right, but weeks, had been spent in recovering health
and spirit, the old man's first word was a gentle rebuke for his
having been left unaware of how far matters had gone; but he cut
short the attempted reply, but saying he knew it was chiefly owing
to his own over-hasty conclusion, and fear of letting his grandson
injure himself by vainly discussing the subject.&nbsp; Now,
however, he examined Berenger closely on all the proceedings Paris
and at Montpipeau, and soon understood that the ceremony had been
renewed, ratifying the vows taken in infancy.&nbsp; The old
statesman's face cleared up at once; for, as he explained, he had
now no anxieties as to the validity of the marriage by English law,
at least, in spite of the decree from Rome, which, as he pointed
out to his grandson, was wholly contingent on the absence of
subsequent consent, since the parties had come to an age for
free-will.&nbsp; Had he known of this, the re-marriage, he said, he
should certainly have been less supine.&nbsp; Why had Berenger been
silent?</p>

<p>'I was commanded, sir.&nbsp; I fear I have transgressed the
command by mentioning it now.&nbsp; I must pray you to be
secret.'</p>

<p>'Secret, foolish lad.&nbsp; Know you not that the rights of your
wife and your children rest upon it?'&nbsp; and as the change in
Berenger's looks showed that he had not comprehended the full
importance of the second ceremony as nullifying the papal sentence,
which could only quash the first on the ground of want of mutual
consent, he proceeded, 'Command, quotha?&nbsp; Who there had any
right to command you, boy?'</p>

<p>'Only one, sir.'</p>

<p>'Come, this no moment for lover's folly.&nbsp; It was not the
girl, then?&nbsp; Then it could no other than the miserable
King--was it so?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'He bade me as king, and
requested me as the friend who gave her to me.&nbsp; I could do no
otherwise, and I thought it would be but a matter of a few days,
and that our original marriage was the only important one.'</p>

<p>'Have you any parchment to prove it?'</p>

<p>'No, sir.&nbsp; It passed but as a ceremony to satisfy the
Queen's scruples ere she gave my wife to me to take home.&nbsp; I
even think the King was displeased at her requiring it.'</p>

<p>'Was Mr. Sidney a witness?'</p>

<p>'No, sir.&nbsp; None was present, save the King and Queen, her
German countess, and the German priest.'</p>

<p>'The day?'</p>

<p>'Lammas-day.'</p>

<p>'The 1<sup>st</sup> of August of the year of grace 1572.&nbsp; I
will write to Walsingham to obtain the testimony, if possible, of
king or of priest; but belike they will deny it all.&nbsp; It was
part of the trick.&nbsp; Shame upon it that a king should dig pits
for so small a game as you, my poor lad!'</p>

<p>'Verily, my Lord,' said Berenger, 'I think the King meant us
kindly, and would gladly have sped us well away.&nbsp; Methought he
felt his bondage bitterly, and would fain have dared to be a true
king.&nbsp; Even at the last, he bade me to his <i>garde-robe</i>,
and all there were unhurt.'</p>

<p>'And wherefore obeyed you not?'</p>

<p>'The carouse would have kept me too late for our flight.'</p>

<p>'King's behests may not lightly be disregarded,' said the old
courtier, with a smile.&nbsp; 'However, since he showed such
seeming favour to you, surely you might send a petition to him
privately, through Sir Francis Walsingham, to let the priest
testify to your renewal of contract, engaging not to use it to his
detriment in France.'</p>

<p>'I will do so, sir.&nbsp; Meanwhile,' he added, as one who felt
he had earned a right to be heard in his turn, 'I have your
permission to hasten to bring home my wife?'</p>

<p>Lord Walwyn was startled at this demand from one still so far
from recovered as Berenger.&nbsp; Even this talk, eager as the
youth was, had not been carried on without much difficulty,
repetitions, and altered phrases, when he could not pronounce
distinctly enough to be understood and the effort brought lines of
pain into his brow.&nbsp; He could take little solid food, had
hardly any strength for walking or riding; and, though all his
wounds were whole, except that one unmanageable shot in the mouth,
he looked entirely unfit to venture on a long journey in the very
country that had sent him home a year before scarcely alive.&nbsp;
Lord Walwyn had already devised what he thought a far more
practicable arrangement; namely, to send Mr. Adderley and some of
my Lady's women by sea, under the charge of Master Hobbs, a
shipmaster at Weymouth, who traded with Bordeaux for wine, and
could easily put in near La Sablerie, and bring off the lady and
child, and, if she wished it, the pastor to whom such a debt of
gratitude was owing.</p>

<p>Berenger was delighted with the notion of the sea rather than
the land journey; but he pointed out at once that this would remove
all objection to his going in person.&nbsp; He had often been out
whole nights with the fishermen, and knew that a sea-voyage would
be better for his health than anything,--certainly better than
pining and languishing at home, as he had done for months.&nbsp; He
could not bear to think of separation from Eustacie an hour longer
than needful; nay, she had been cruelly entreated enough already;
and as long as he could keep his feet, it was absolutely due to her
that he should not let others, instead of himself, go in search of
her.&nbsp; It would be almost death to him to stay at home.</p>

<p>Lord Walwyn looked at the pallid, wasted face, with all its
marks of suffering and intense eagerness of expression, increased
by the difficulty of utterance and need of subduing
agitation.&nbsp; He felt that the long-misunderstood patience and
endurance had earned something; and he knew, too, that for all his
grandson's submission and respect, the boy, as a husband and
father, had rights and duties that would assert themselves manfully
if opposed.&nbsp; It was true that the sea-voyage obviated many
difficulties, and it was better to consent with a good grace than
drive one hitherto so dutiful to rebellion.&nbsp; He did then
consent, and was rewarded by the lightning flash of joy and
gratitude in the bright blue eyes, and the fervent pressure and
kiss of his hand, as Berenger exclaimed, 'Ah! sir, Eustacie will be
such a daughter to you.&nbsp; You should have seen how the Admiral
liked her!'</p>

<p>The news of Lord Walwyn's consent raised much commotion in the
family.&nbsp; Dame Annora was sure her poor son would be murdered
outright this time, and that nobody cared because he was only HER
son; and she strove hard to stir up Sir Marmaduke to remonstrate
with her father; but the good knight had never disputed a judgment
of 'my Lord's' in his whole life, and had even received his first
wife from his hands, when forsaken by the gay Annora.&nbsp; So she
could only ride over the Combe, be silenced by her father, as
effectually as if Jupiter had nodded, and bewail and murmur to her
mother till she lashed Lady Walwyn up into finding every possible
reason why Berenger should and must sail.&nbsp; Then she went home,
was very sharp with Lucy, and was reckoned by saucy little Nan to
have nineteen times exclaimed 'Tilley-valley' in the course of one
day.</p>

<p>The effect upon Philip was a vehement insistence on going with
his brother.&nbsp; He was sure no one else would see to Berry half
as well; and as to letting Berry go to be murdered again without
him, he would not hear of it; he must go, he would not stay at
home; he should not study; no, no, he should be ready to hang
himself for vexation, and thinking what they were doing to his
brother.&nbsp; And thus he extorted from his kind-hearted father an
avowal that he should be easier a bout the lad if Phil were there,
and that he might go, provided Berry would have him, and my Lord
saw no objection.&nbsp; The first point was soon settled; and as to
the second, there was no reason at all that Philip should not go
where his brother did.&nbsp; In fact, excepting for Berenger's
state of health, there was hardly any risk about the matter.&nbsp;
Master Hobbs, to whom Philip rode down ecstatically to request him
to come and speak to my Lord, was a stout, honest, experienced
seaman, who was perfectly at home in the Bay of Biscay, and had so
strong a feudal feeling for the house of Walwyn, that he placed
himself and his best ship, the THROSTLE, entirely at his
disposal.&nbsp; The THROSTLE was a capital sailor, and carried arms
quite sufficient in English hands to protect her against Algerine
corsairs or Spanish pirates.&nbsp; He only asked for a week to make
her cabin ready for the reception of a lady, and this time was
spent in sending a post to London, to obtain for Berenger the
permit from the Queen, and the passport from the French Ambassador,
without which he could not safely have gone; and, as a further
precaution, letters were requested from some of the secret agents
of the Huguenots to facilitate his admission into La Sablerie.</p>

<p>In the meantime, poor Mr. Adderley had submitted meekly to the
decree that sentenced him to weeks of misery on board the THROSTLE,
but to his infinite relief, an inspection of the cabins proved the
space so small, that Berenger represented to him grandfather that
the excellent tutor would be only an encumbrance to himself and
every one else, and that with Philip he should need no one.&nbsp;
Indeed, he had made such a start into vigour and alertness during
the last few days that there was far less anxiety about him, though
with several sighs for poor Osbert.&nbsp; Cecily initiated Philip
into her simple rules for her patient's treatment in case of the
return of his more painful symptoms.&nbsp; The notion of sending
female attendants for Eustacie was also abandoned: her husband's
presence rendered them unnecessary, or they might be procured at La
Sablerie; and thus it happened that the only servants whom Berenger
was to take with him were Humfrey Holt and John Smithers, the same
honest fellows whose steadiness had so much conduced to his rescue
at Paris.</p>

<p>Claude de Mericour had in the meantime been treated as an
honoured guest at Combe Walwyn, and was in good esteem with its
master.&nbsp; He would have set forth at once on his journey to
Scotland, but that Lord Walwyn advised him to wait and ascertain
the condition of his relatives there before throwing himself on
them.&nbsp; Berenger had, accordingly, when writing to Sidney by
the messenger above mentioned, begged him to find out from Sir
Robert Melville, the Scottish Envoy, all he could about the family
whose designation he wrote down at a venture from Mericour's
lips.</p>

<p>Sidney returned a most affectionate answer, saying that he had
never been able to believe the little shepherdess a traitor and was
charmed that she had proved herself a heroine; he should endeavour
to greet her with all his best powers as a poet, when she should
brighten the English court; but his friend, Master Spenser, alone
was fit to celebrate such constancy.&nbsp; As to M. l'Abbe de
Mericour's friends, Sir Robert Melville had recognized their name
at once, and had pronounced them to be fierce Catholics and
Queensmen, so sorely pressed by the Douglases, that it was believed
they would soon fly the country altogether; and Sidney added, what
Lord Walwyn had already said, that to seek Scotland rather than
France as a resting-place in which to weigh between Calvinism and
Catholicism, was only trebly hot and fanatical.&nbsp; His counsel
was that M. de Mericour should so far conform himself to the
English Church as to obtain admission to one of the universities,
and, through his uncle of Leicester, he could obtain for him an
opening at Oxford, where he might fully study the subject.</p>

<p>There was much to incline Mericour to accept this counsel.&nbsp;
He had had much conversation with Mr. Adderley, and had attended
his ministrations in the chapel, and both satisfied him far better
than what he had seen among the French Calvinists; and the peace
and family affection of the two houses were like a new world to
him.&nbsp; But he had not yet made up his mind to that absolute
disavowal of his own branch of the Church, which alone could have
rendered him eligible for any foundation at Oxford.&nbsp; His
attainments in classics would, Mr. Adderley thought, reach such a
standard as to gain one of the very few scholarships open to
foreigners; and his noble blood revolted at becoming a pensioner of
Leicester's, or of any other nobleman.</p>

<p>Lord Walwyn, upon this, made an earnest offer of his
hospitality, and entreated the young man to remain at Hurst Walwyn
till the return of Berenger and Philip, during which time he might
study under the directions of Mr. Adderley, and come to a decision
whether to seek reconciliation with his native Church and his
brother, or to remain in England.&nbsp; In this latter case, he
might perhaps accompany both the youths to Oxford, for, in spite of
Berenger's marriage, his education was still not supposed to be
complete.&nbsp; And when Mericour still demurred with reluctance to
become a burden on the bounty of the noble house, he was reminded
gracefully of the debt of gratitude that the family owed to him for
the relief he had brought to Berenger; and, moreover, Dame Annora
giggled out that, 'if he would teach Nan and Bess to speak and read
French and Italian, it would be worth something to them.'&nbsp; The
others of the family would have hushed up this uncalled-for
proposal; but Mericour caught at it as the most congenial mode of
returning the obligation.&nbsp; Every morning he undertook to walk
or ride over to the Manor, and there gave his lessons to the young
ladies, with whom he was extremely popular.&nbsp; He was a far more
brilliant teacher than Lucy, and ten thousand times preferable to
Mr. Adderley, who had once begun to teach Annora her accidence with
lamentable want of success.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.&nbsp; THE EMPTY CRADLE</h3>

<p>Eager to know</p>

<p>The worst, and with that fatal certainty</p>

<p>To terminate intolerable dread,</p>

<p>He spurred his courser forward--all his fears</p>

<p>Too surely are fulfilled.--SOUTHEY</p>

<p>Contrary winds made the voyage of the THROSTLE much more tardy
than had been reckoned on by Berenger's impatience; but hope was
before him, and he often remembered his days in the little vessel
as much happier than he had known them to be at the time.</p>

<p>It was in the calm days of right October that Captain Hobbs at
length was putting into the little harbour nearest to La
Sablerie.&nbsp; Berenger, on that morning, had for the first time
been seized by a fit of anxiety as to the impression his face would
make, with its terrible purple scar, great patch, and bald
forehead, and had brought out a little black velvet mask, called a
<i>tour de nez</i>, often used in riding to protect the complexion,
intending to prepare Eustacie for his disfigurement.&nbsp; He had
fastened on a carnation-coloured sword-knot, would a scarf of the
same colour across his shoulder, clasped a long ostrich plume into
his broad Spanish hat, and looked out his deeply-fringed Spanish
gloves; and Philip was laughing merrily, not to say rudely, at him,
for trying to deck himself out so bravely.</p>

<p>'See, Master Hobbs,' cried the boy in his high spirits, as he
followed his brother on deck, 'you did not know you had so fine a
gallant on board.&nbsp; Here be braveries for my Lady.'</p>

<p>'Hush, Phil,' broke in Berenger, who had hitherto taken all the
raillery in perfect good part.&nbsp; 'What is amiss, Master
Hobbs?'</p>

<p>'I cannot justly say, sir,' returned Master Hobbs, without
taking his gaze off the coast, 'but by yonder banks and creeks this
should be the Sables d'Olonne; and I do not see the steeple of La
Sablerie, which has always been the landmark for the harbour of
St.&nbsp; Julien.'</p>

<p>'What do you understand by that?' asked Berenger, more struck by
his manner than his words.</p>

<p>'Well, sir, if I am right, a steeple that has stood three or
four hundred years does not vanish out of sight like a cloud of
smoke for nothing.&nbsp; I may be lightning, to be sure; or the
Protestants may have had it down for Popery; but methinks they
would have too much Christian regard for poor mariners than to
knock down the only landmark on this coast till you come to Nissard
spire.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he hailed the man at the mast-head,
demanding if he saw the steeple of La Sablerie.&nbsp; 'No, no,
sir.'&nbsp; But as other portions of the land became clearer, there
was no doubt that the THROSTLE was right in her bearings; so the
skipper gave orders to cast anchor and lower a boat.&nbsp; The
passengers would have pressed him with inquiries as to what he
thought the absence of his landmark could portend; but he hurried
about, and shouted orders, with the deaf despotism of a nautical
commander; and only when all was made ready, turned round and said,
'Now, sir, maybe you had best let me go ashore first, and find out
how the land lies.'</p>

<p>'Never!' said Berenger, in an agony of impatience.</p>

<p>'I thought so,' said the captain. 'Well, then, sir, are your
fellows ready?&nbsp; Armed?&nbsp; All right.'</p>

<p>So Berenger descended to the boat, followed by Philip; next came
the captain, and then the two serving-men.&nbsp; Six of the crew
were ready to row them to the shore, and were bidden by their
captain to return at once to the vessel, and only return on a
signal from him.&nbsp; the surging rush of intense anxiety, sure to
precede the destined moment of the consummation of hope long
deferred, kept Berenger silent, choked by something between fear
and prayer; but Philip, less engrossed, asked Master Hobbs if it
were not strange that none of the inhabitants of the squalid little
huts on the shore had not put out to greet them in some of the
boats that were drawn up on the beach.</p>

<p>'Poor wretches,' said Hobbs; 'they scarce know friend from foe,
and are slow to run their heads into the lion's mouth.&nbsp;
Strange fellows have the impudence to sail under our flag at
times.'</p>

<p>However, as they neared the low, flat, sandy shore, a few red
caps peeped out at the cottage-doors, and then, apparently gaining
confidence from the survey, some wiry, active figures appeared, and
were hailed by Hobbs.&nbsp; His Bordeax trade had rendered him
master of the coast language; and a few incomprehensible shouts
between him and the natives resulted in a line being thrown to
them, and the boat dragged as near as possible to the
landing-place, when half a dozen ran up, splashing with their bare
legs, to offer their shoulders for the transport of the passengers,
both of whom were seized upon before they were aware, Philip
struggling with all his might, till a call from Captain Hobbs
warned him to resign himself; and then he became almost helpless
with laughter at the figure cut by the long-legged Berenger upon a
small fisherman's back.</p>

<p>They were landed.&nbsp; Could it be that Berenger was only two
miles-- only half an hour's walk form Eustacie?&nbsp; The bound his
heart gave as he touched the shore seemed to stifle him.&nbsp; He
could not believe it.&nbsp; Yet he knew how fully he had believed
it, the next moment, when he listened to what the fishermen were
saying to Captain Hobbs.</p>

<p>'Did Monsieur wish to go to La Sablerie?&nbsp; Ah! then he did
not know what had happened.&nbsp; The soldiers had been there;
there had been a great burning.&nbsp; They had been out in their
boats at sea, but they had seen the sky red--red as a furnace, all
night; and the steeple was down.&nbsp; Surely, Monsieur had missed
the steeple that was a guide to all poor seafarers; and now they
had to go all the way to Brancour to sell their fish.'</p>

<p>'And the townspeople?'&nbsp; Hobbs asked.</p>

<p>'Ah! poor things; 'twas pity of them, for they were honest folk
to deal with, even if they were heretics.&nbsp; They loved fish at
other seasons if not in Lent; and it seemed but a fair return to go
up and bury as many of them as were not burnt to nothing in their
church; and Dom Colombeau, the good priest of Nissard, has said it
was a pious work; and he was a saint, if any one was.'</p>

<p>'Alack, sir,' said Hobbs, laying his hand on the arm of
Berenger, who seemed neither to have breathed nor moved while the
man was speaking: 'I feared that there had been some such bloody
work when I missed the steeple.&nbsp; But take heart yet: your lady
is very like to have been out of the way.&nbsp; We might make for
La Rochelle, and there learn!' Then, again to the fisherman, 'None
escaped, fellow?'</p>

<p>'Not one,' replied the man.&nbsp; 'they say that one of the
great folks was in a special rage with them for sheltering the lady
he should have wedded, but who had broken convent and turned
heretic; and they had victualled Montgomery's pirates too.'</p>

<p>'And the lady?' continued Hobbs, ever trying to get a more
supporting hold of his young charge, in case the rigid tension of
his limbs should suddenly relax.'</p>

<p>'I cannot tell, sir.&nbsp; I am a poor fisher; but I could guide
you to the place where old Gillot is always poking about.&nbsp; He
listened to their preachings, and knows more than we do.'</p>

<p>'Let us go,' said Berenger, at once beginning to stride along in
his heavy boots through the deep sand.&nbsp; Philip, who had hardly
understood a word of the <i>patois</i>, caught hold of him, and
begged to be told what had happened; but Master Hobbs drew the boy
off, and explained to him and to the two men what were the dreadful
tidings that had wrought such a change in Berenger's
demeanour.&nbsp; The way over the shifting sands was toilsome
enough to all the rest of the party; but Berenger scarcely seemed
to feel the deep plunge at every step as they almost ploughed their
way along for the weary two miles, before a few green bushes and
half-choked trees showed that they were reaching the confines of
the sandy waste.&nbsp; Berenger had not uttered a word the whole
time, and his silence hushed the others.&nbsp; The ground began to
rise, grass was seen still struggling to grow, and presently a
large straggling mass of black and gray ruins revealed themselves,
with the remains of a once well-trodden road leading to them.&nbsp;
But the road led to a gate-way choked by a fallen jamb and barred
door, and the guide led them round the ruins of the wall to the
opening where the breach had been.&nbsp; The sand was already
blowing in, and no doubt veiled much; for the streets were scarcely
traceable through remnants of houses more or less dilapidated, with
shreds of broken or burnt household furniture within them.</p>

<p>'Ask him for <i>la rue des Trois Fees</i>,' hoarsely whispered
Berenger.</p>

<p>The fisherman nodded, but soon seemed at fault; and an old man,
followed by a few children, soon appearing, laden with piece of
fuel, he appealed to him as Father Gillot, and asked whether he
could find the street.&nbsp; The old man seemed at home in the
ruins, and led the way readily.&nbsp; 'Did he know the Widow
Laurent's house?'</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle [footnote: This was the title of <i>bourgeoise</i>
wives, for many years, in France.] Laurent!&nbsp; Full well he knew
her; a good pious soul was she, always ready to die for the truth,'
he added, as he read sympathy in the faces round; 'and no doubt she
had witnessed a good confession.'</p>

<p>'Knew he aught of the lady she had lodged?'</p>

<p>'He knew nothing of ladies.&nbsp; Something he had heard of the
good widow having sheltered that shining light, Isaac Gardon,
quenched, no doubt, in the same destruction; but for his part, he
had a daughter in one of the isles out there, who always sent for
him if she suspected danger here on the mainland, and he had only
returned to his poor farm a day or two after Michaelmas.'&nbsp; So
saying, he led them to the threshold of a ruinous building, in the
very centre, as it were, of the desolation, and said, 'That,
gentlemen, is where the poor honest widow kept her little
shop.'</p>

<p>Black, burnt, dreary, lay the hospitable abode.&nbsp; The
building had fallen, but the beams of the upper floor had fallen
aslant, so as to shelter a portion of the lower room, where the
red-tile pavement, the hearth with the gray ashes of the harmless
home-fire, some unbroken crocks, a chain, and a <i>sabot</i>, were
still visible, making the contrast of dreariness doubly
mournful.</p>

<p>Berenger had stepped over the threshold, with his hat in his
hand, as if the ruin were a sacred place to him, and stood gazing
in a transfixed, deadened way.&nbsp; The captain asked where the
remains were.</p>

<p>'Our people,' said the old man and the fisher, 'laid them by
night in the earth near the church.'</p>

<p>Just then Berenger's gaze fell on something half hidden under
the fallen timbers.&nbsp; He instantly sprang forward, and used all
his strength to drag it out in so headlong a manner that all the
rest hurried to prevent his reckless proceedings from bringing the
heavy beams down on his head.&nbsp; When brought to light, the
object proved to be one of the dark, heavy, wooden cradles used by
the French peasantry, shining with age, but untouched by fire.</p>

<p>'Look in,' Berenger signed to Philip, his own eyes averted, his
mouth set.</p>

<p>The cradle was empty, totally empty, save for a woollen
covering, a little mattress, and a string of small yellow shells
threaded.</p>

<p>Berenger held out his hand, grasped the baby-play thing
convulsively, then dropped upon his knees, clasping his hands over
his ashy face, the string of shells still wound among his
fingers.&nbsp; Perhaps he had hitherto hardly realized the
existence of his child, and was solely wrapped up in the thought of
his wife; but the wooden cradle, the homely toy, stirred up fresh
depths of feelings; he saw Eustacie wither tender sweetness as a
mother, he beheld the little likeness of her in the cradle; and oh!
that this should have been the end!&nbsp; Unable to repress a moan
of anguish from a bursting heart, he laid his face against the
senseless wood, and kissed it again and again, then lay motionless
against it save for the long-drawn gasps and sobs that shook his
frame.&nbsp; Philip, torn to the heart, would have almost forcibly
drawn him away; but Master Hobbs, with tears running down his
honest cheeks, withheld the boy.&nbsp; 'Don't ye, Master
Thistlewood, 'twill do him good.&nbsp; Poor young gentleman!&nbsp;
I know how it was when I came home and found our first little lad,
that we had thought so much on, had been take.&nbsp; But then he
was safe laid in his own churchyard, and his mother was there to
meet me; while your poor brother---Ah! God comfort him!'</p>

<p><i>'Le pauvre Monsieur</i>!' exclaimed the old peasant, struck
at the sight of his grief, 'was it then his child?&nbsp; And he, no
doubt, lying wounded elsewhere while God's hand was heavy on this
place.&nbsp; Yet he might hear more.&nbsp; They said the priest
came down and carried off the little ones to be bred up in
convents.'</p>

<p>'Who?--where?' asked Berenger, raising his head as if catching
at a straw in this drowning of all his hopes.</p>

<p>''Tis true,' added the fisherman. 'It was the holy priest of
Nissard, for he send down to St. Julien for a woman to nurse the
babes.'</p>

<p>'To Nissard, then,' said Berenger, rising.</p>

<p>'It is but a chance,' said the old Huguenot; 'many of the
innocents were with their mothers in yonder church.&nbsp; Better
for them to perish like the babes of Bethlehem than to be bred up
in the house of Baal; but perhaps Monsieur is English, and if so he
might yet obtain the child.&nbsp; Yet he must not hope too
much.'</p>

<p>'No, for there was many a little corpse among those we buried,'
said the fisher.&nbsp; 'Will the gentleman see the place?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no!' exclaimed Philip, understanding the actions, and
indeed many of the words; 'this place will kill him.'</p>

<p>'To the grave,' said Berenger, as if he heard nothing.</p>

<p>'See,' added Philip, 'there are better things than graves,' and
he pointed to a young green sucker of a vine, which, stimulated by
the burnt soil, had shot up between the tiles of the floor.&nbsp;
'Look, there is hope to meet you even here.'</p>

<p>Berenger merely answered by gathering a leaf from the vine and
putting it into his bosom; and Philip, whom only extreme need could
have thus inspired, perceived that he accepted it as the augury of
hope.</p>

<p>Berenger turned to bid the two men bear the cradle with them,
and then followed the old man out into the PLACE, once a pleasant
open paved square, now grass-grown and forlorn.&nbsp; On one side
lay the remains of the church.&nbsp; The Huguenots had been so
predominant at La Sablerie as to have engrossed the building, and
it had therefore shared the general destruction, and lay in utter,
desolate ruin, a mere shell, and the once noble spire, the
mariner's guiding star, blown up with gun-cruel that ever desolated
the country.&nbsp; Beyond lay the burial-ground, in unspeakable
dreariness.&nbsp; The crossed of the Catholic dead had been
levelled by the fanaticism of the Huguenots, and though a great
dominant stone cross raised on steps had been re-erected, it stood
uneven, tottering and desolate among nettles, weeds, and
briers.&nbsp; There seemed to have been a few deep trenches dug to
receive the bodies of the many victims of the siege, and only
rudely and slightly filled in with loose earth, on which Philippe
treading had nearly sunk in, so much to his horror that he could
hardly endure the long contemplation in which his brother stood
gazing on the dismal scene, as if to bear it away with him.&nbsp;
Did the fair being he had left in a king's palace sleep her last
sleep her last sleep amid the tangled grass, the thistles and
briers that grew so close that it was hardly possible to keep from
stumbling over them, where all memorials of friend or foe were
alike obliterated?&nbsp; Was a resting-place among these nameless
graves the best he could hope for the wife whose eyes he had hoped
by this time would be answering his own--was this her shelter from
foe, from sword, famine, and fire?</p>

<p>A great sea-bird, swooping along with broad wings and wild
wailing cry, completed the weird dismay that had seized on Philip,
and clutching at his brother's cloak, he exclaimed, 'Berry, Berry,
let us be gone, or we shall both be distraught!'</p>

<p>Berenger yielded passively, but when the ruins of the town had
been again crossed, and the sad little party, after amply rewarding
the old man, were about to return to St. Julien, he stood still,
saying, 'Which is the way to Nissard?' and, as the men pointed to
the south, he added, 'Show me the way thither.'</p>

<p>Captain Hobbs now interfered.&nbsp; He knew the position of
Nissard, among dangerous sandbanks, between which a boat could only
venture at the higher tides, and by daylight.&nbsp; To go the six
miles thither at present would make it almost impossible to return
to the THROSTLE that night, and it was absolutely necessary that he
at least should do this.&nbsp; He therefore wished the young
gentleman to return with him on board, sleep there, and be put
ashore at Nissard as soon as it should be possible in the morning.
But Berenger shook his head.&nbsp; He could not rest for a moment
till he had ascertained the fate of Eustacie's child.&nbsp; Action
alone could quench the horror of what he had recognized as her own
lot, and the very pursuit of this one thread of hope seemed needful
to him to make it substantial.&nbsp; He would hear of nothing but
walking at once to Nissard; and Captain Hobbs, finding it
impossible to debate the point with one so dazed and crushed with
grief, and learning from the fishermen that not only was the priest
one of the kindest and most hospitable men living, but that there
was a tolerable <i>caberet</i> not far from the house, selected
from the loiterers who had accompanied them from St. Julien a
trustworthy-looking, active lad as a guide, and agreed with the
high tide on the morrow, either to concert measures for obtaining
possession of the lost infant, or, if all were in vain, to fetch
them off.&nbsp; Then he, with the mass of stragglers from St.
Julien, went off direct for the coast, while the two young
brothers, their two attendants, and the fishermen, turned
southwards along the summit of the dreary sandbanks.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.&nbsp; THE GOOD PRIEST OF NISSARD</h3>

<p>Till at the set of sun all tracks and ways</p>

<p>In darkness lay enshrouded.&nbsp; And e'en thus</p>

<p>The utmost limit of the great profound</p>

<p>At length we reach'd, where in dark gloom and mist</p>

<p>Cimmeria's people and their city lie</p>

<p>Enveloped ever.--ODYSSEY (MUSGROVE)</p>

<p>The October afternoon had set in before the brothers were the
way to Nissard; and in spite of Berenger's excited mood, the walk
through the soft, sinking sand could not be speedily
performed.&nbsp; It was that peculiar sand-drift which is the curse
of so many coasts, slowly, silently, irresistibly flowing, blowing,
creeping in, and gradually choking all vegetation and
habitation.&nbsp; Soft and almost impalpable, it lay heaped in
banks yielding as air, and yet far more than deep enough to swallow
up man and horse.&nbsp; Nay, tops of trees, summits of chimneys,
told what it had already swallowed.&nbsp; The whole scene far and
wide presented nothing but the lone, tame undulations, liable to be
changed by every wind, and solitary beyond expression--a few
rabbits scudding hither and thither, or a sea-gull floating with
white, ghostly wings in the air, being the only living things
visible.&nbsp; On the one hand a dim, purple horizon showed that
the inhabited country lay miles inland; on the other lay the pale,
gray, misty expanse of sea, on which Philip's eyes could lovingly
discern the THROSTLE'S masts.</p>

<p>That view was Philip's chief comfort.&nbsp; The boy was feeling
more eerie and uncomfortable than ever he had been before as he
plodded along, sinking deep with every step almost up to his ankles
in the sand, on which the bare-footed guide ran lightly, and
Berenger, though sinking no less deeply, seemed insensible to all
inconveniences.&nbsp; This desolateness was well-nigh unbearable;
no one dared to speak while Berenger thus moved on in the
unapproachableness of his great grief, and Philip presently began
to feel a dreamy sense that they had all thus been moving for
years, that this was the world's end, the land of shadows, and that
his brother was a ghost already.&nbsp; Besides vague alarms like
these, there was the dismal English and Protestant prejudice in
full force in Philip's mind, which regarded the resent ground as
necessarily hostile, and all Frenchmen, above all French priests,
as in league to cut off every Englishman and Protestant.&nbsp; He
believed himself in a country full of murderers, and was walking on
with the one determination that his brother should not rush on
danger without him, and that the Popish rogues should be kept in
mind that there was an English ship in sight.&nbsp; Alas! that
consolation was soon lost, for a dense gray mist was slowly
creeping in from the sea, and blotted out the vessel, then gathered
in closer, and obliterated all landmarks.&nbsp; Gradually it turned
to a heavy rain, and about the same time the ground on which they
walked became no longer loose sand-hills, but smooth and
level.&nbsp; It was harder likewise from the wet, and this afforded
better walking, but there lay upon it fragments of weed and shell,
as though it were liable to be covered by the sea, and there was a
low, languid plash of the tide, which could not be seen.&nbsp;
Twilight began to deepen the mist.&nbsp; The guide was evidently
uneasy; he sidled up to Philip, and began to ask what he--hitherto
obstinately deaf and contemptuous to French--was very slow to
comprehend.&nbsp; At last he found it was a question how near it
was to All Soul's day; and then came an equally amazing query
whether the gentlemen's babe had been baptized; for it appeared
that on All Soul's day the spirits of unchristened infants had the
power of rising from the sands in a bewildering mist, and leading
wayfarers into the sea.&nbsp; And the poor guide, white and
drenched, vowed he never would have undertaken this walk if he had
only thought of this.&nbsp; These slaughters of heretics must so
much have augmented the number of the poor little spirits; and no
doubt Monsieur would be specially bewildered by one so nearly
concerned with him.&nbsp; Philip, half frightened, could not help
stepping forward and pulling Berenger by the cloak to make him
aware of this strange peril; but he did not get much comfort.&nbsp;
'Baptized?&nbsp; Yes; you know she was, by the old nurse.&nbsp; Let
me alone, I say.&nbsp; I would follow her wherever she called me,
the innocent, and glad--the sooner the better.'</p>

<p>And he shook his brother off with a sadness and impatience so
utterly unapproachable, that Philip, poor boy, could only watch his
tall figure in the wide cloak and slouched hat, stalking on ever
more indistinct in the gloom, while his much confused mind tried to
settle the theological point whether the old nurse's baptism were
valid enough to prevent poor little Berangere from becoming one of
these mischievous deluders; and all this was varied by the notion
of Captain Hobbs picking up their corpses on the beach, and of Sir
Marmaduke bewailing his only son.</p>

<p>At last a strange muffled sound made him start in the dead
silence, but the guide hailed the sound with a joyful cry---</p>

<p>'Hola! Blessings on Notre-Dame and holy Father Colombeau, now
are we saved!'&nbsp; and on Philip's hasty interrogation, he
explained that it was from the bells of Nissard, which the good
priest always caused to be rung during these sea-fogs, to disperse
all evil beings, and guide the wanderers.</p>

<p>The guide strode on manfully, as the sound became clearer and
nearer, and Philip was infinitely relived to be free from all
supernatural anxieties, and to have merely to guard against the
wiles of a Polish priest, a being almost as fabulously endowed in
his imagination as poor little Beranger's soul could be in that of
the fisherman.</p>

<p>The drenching Atlantic mist had wetted them all to the skin, and
closed round them so like a solid wall, that they had almost lost
sight of each other, and had nothing but the bells' voices to
comfort them, till quite suddenly there was a light upon the mist,
a hazy reddish gleam--a window seemed close to them.&nbsp; The
guide, heartily thanking Our Lady and St. Julian, knocked at a
door, which opened at once into a warm, bright, superior sort of
kitchen, where a neatly-dressed elderly peasant woman exclaimed,
'Welcome, poor souls!&nbsp; Enter, then.&nbsp; Here, good Father,
are some bewildered creatures.&nbsp; Eh! wrecked are you, good
folks, or lost in the fog?'</p>

<p>At the same moment there came from behind the screen that shut
off the fire from the door, a benignant-looking, hale old man in a
cassock, with long white hair on his shoulders, and a cheerful
face, ruddy from sea-wind.</p>

<p>'Welcome, my friends,' he said.&nbsp; 'Thanks to the saints who
have guided you safely.&nbsp; You are drenched.&nbsp; Come to the
fire at once.'</p>

<p>And as they moved on into the full light of the fire and the
rude iron lamp by which he had been reading, and he saw the
draggled plumes and other appurtenances that marked the two youths
as gentlemen, he added, 'Are you wrecked, Messieurs?&nbsp; We will
do our poor best for your accommodation;' and while both
mechanically murmured a word of thanks, and removed their soaked
hats, the good man exclaimed, as he beheld Berenger's ashy face,
with the sunken eyes and deep scars, 'Monsieur should come to bed
at once.&nbsp; He is apparently recovering from a severe
wound.&nbsp; This way, sir;&nbsp; Jolitte shall make you some hot
tisane.'</p>

<p>'Wait, sir,' said Berenger, very slowly, and his voice sounding
hollow from exhaustion; 'they say that you can tell me of my
child.&nbsp; Let me hear.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur's child!' exclaimed the bewildered curate, looking
from him to Philip, and then to the guide, who poured out a whole
stream of explanation before Philip had arranged three words of
French.</p>

<p>'You hear, sir,' said Berenger, as the man finished:&nbsp; 'I
came hither to seek my wife, the Lady of Ribaumont.'</p>

<p>'Eh!' exclaimed the <i>cure</i>, 'do I then see M. le Marquis de
Nid de Merle?'</p>

<p>'No!' cried Berenger; 'no, I am not that <i>scelerat</i>!&nbsp;
I am her true husband, the Baron de Ribaumont.'</p>

<p>'The Baron de Ribaumont perished at the St. Bartholomew,' said
the <i>cure</i>, fixing his eyes on him, as though to confute an
impostor.</p>

<p>'Ah, would that I had!' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'I was barely saved
with the life that is but misery now.&nbsp; I came to seek her--I
found what you know.&nbsp; They told me that you saved the
children.&nbsp; Ah, tell me where mine is!--all that is left
me.'</p>

<p>'A few poor babes I was permitted to rescue, but very few.&nbsp;
But let me understand to whom I speak,' he added, much
perplexed.&nbsp; 'You, sir---'</p>

<p>'I am her husband, married at five years old--contract renewed
last year.&nbsp; It was he whom you call Nid de Merle who fell on
me, and left me for dead.&nbsp; A faithful servant saved my life,
but I have lain sick in England till now, when her letter to my
mother brought me to La Sablerie, to find--to find THIS.&nbsp; Oh,
sir, have pity on me!&nbsp; Tell me if you know anything of her, or
if you can give me her child.'</p>

<p>'The orphans I was able to save are--the boys at nurse here, the
girls with the good nuns at Lucon,' said the priest, with infinite
pity in his look.&nbsp; 'Should you know it, sir?'</p>

<p>'I would--I should,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'But it is a
girl.&nbsp; Ah, would that it were here!&nbsp; But you--you,
sir--you know more than these fellows.&nbsp; Is there no--no hope
of herself?'</p>

<p>'Alas! I fear I can give you none,' said the priest; 'but I will
tell all I know; only I would fain see you eat, rest, and be
dried.'</p>

<p>'How can I?' gasped he, allowing himself, however, to sink into
a chair; and the priest spoke:</p>

<p>'Perhaps you know, sir, that the poor lady fled from her
friends, and threw herself upon the Huguenots.&nbsp; All trace had
been lost, when, at a banquet given by the mayor of Lucon, there
appeared some <i>patisseries</i>, which some ecclesiastic, who had
enjoyed the hospitality of Bellaise, recognized as peculiar to the
convent there, where she had been brought up.&nbsp; They were
presented to the mayor by his friend, Bailli la Grasse, who had
boasted of the excellent <i>confitures</i> of the heretic pastor's
daughter that lodged in the town of La Sablerie.&nbsp; The place
was in disgrace for having afforded shelter and supplies to
Montgomery's pirate crews, and there were narrations of outrages
committed on Catholics.&nbsp; The army were enraged by their
failure before La Rochelle; in effect, it was resolved to make an
example, when, on M. de Nid de Merle's summons, all knowledge of
the lady was denied.&nbsp; Is it possible that she was indeed not
there?'</p>

<p>Berenger shook his head.&nbsp; 'She was indeed there,' he said,
with an irrepressible groan.&nbsp; 'Was there no mercy--none?'</p>

<p>'Ask not, sir,' said the compassionate priest; 'the flesh
shrinks, though there may be righteous justice.&nbsp; A pillaged
town, when men are enraged, is like a place of devils
unchained.&nbsp; I reached it only after it had been taken by
assault, when all was flame and blood.&nbsp; Ask me no more; it
would be worse for you to hear than me to tell,' he concluded,
shuddering, but laying his hand kindly on Berenger's arm.&nbsp; 'At
least it is ended now and God is more merciful than men.&nbsp; Many
died by the bombs cast into to city, and she for whom you ask
certainly fell not alive into the hands of those who sought
her.&nbsp; Take comfort, sir; there is One who watches and takes
count of our griefs.&nbsp; Sir, turning to Philip, 'this gentleman
is too much spent with sorrow to bear this cold and damp.&nbsp; Aid
me, I entreat, to persuade him to lie down.'</p>

<p>Philip understood the priest's French far better than that of
the peasants, and added persuasions that Berenger was far too much
exhausted and stunned to resist.&nbsp; To spend a night in a Popish
priest's house would once have seemed to Philip a shocking
alternative, yet here he was, heartily assisting in removing the
wet garments in which his brother had sat only too long, and was
heartily relieved to lay him down in the priest's own bed, even
though there was an image over the head, which, indeed, the boy
never saw.&nbsp; He only saw his brother turn away from the light
with a low, heavy moan, as if he would fain be left alone with his
sorrow and his crushed hopes.</p>

<p>Nothing could be kinder than Dome Colombeau, the priest of
Nissard.&nbsp; He saw to the whole of his guests being put into
some sort of dry habiliments before they sat round his table to eat
of the savoury mess in the great <i>pot-au-feu</i>, which had,
since their arrival, received additional ingredients, and moreover
sundry villagers had crept into the house.&nbsp; Whenever the good
Father supped at home, any of his flock were welcome to drop in to
enjoy his hospitability.&nbsp; After a cup of hot cider round, they
carried off the fisherman to ledge in one of their cottages.&nbsp;
Shake-downs were found for the others, and Philip, wondering what
was to become of the good host himself, gathered that he meant to
spend such part of the night on the kitchen floor as he did not
pass in prayer in the church for the poor young gentleman, who was
in such affliction.&nbsp; Philip was not certain whether to resent
this as an impertinence or an attack on their Protestant
principles; but he was not sure, either, that the priest was aware
what was their religion, and was still less certain of his own
comprehension of these pious intentions: he decided that, any way,
it was better not to make a fool of himself.&nbsp; Still, the
notion of the mischievousness of priests was so rooted in his head,
that he consulted Humfrey on the expedience of keeping watch all
night, but was sagaciously answered that 'these French rogues don't
do any hurt unless they be brought up to it, and the place was as
safe as old Hurst.'</p>

<p>In fact, Philip's vigilance would have been strongly against
nature.&nbsp; He never awoke till full daylight and morning sun
were streaming through the vine-leaves round the window, and then,
to his dismay, he saw that Berenger had left his bed, and was
gone.&nbsp; Suspicions of foul play coming over him in full force
as he gazed round on much that he considered as "Popish furniture,"
he threw on his clothes, and hastened to open the door, when, to
his great relief, he saw Berenger hastily writing at a table under
the window, and Smithers standing by waiting for the billet.</p>

<p>'I am sending Smithers on board, to ask Hobbs to bring our cloak
bags,' said Berenger, as his brother entered.&nbsp; 'We must go on
to Lucon.'</p>

<p>He spoke briefly and decidedly, and Philip was satisfied to see
him quite calm and collected--white indeed, and with the old
haggard look, and the great scar very purple instead of red, which
was always a bad sign with him.&nbsp; He was not disposed to answer
questions; he shortly said, 'He had slept not less than usual,'
which Philip knew meant very little; and he had evidently made up
his mind, and was resolved not to let himself give way.&nbsp; If
his beacon of hope had been so suddenly, frightfully quenched, he
still was kept from utter darkness by straining his eyes and
forcing his steps to follow the tiny, flickering spark that
remained.</p>

<p>The priest was at his morning mass; and so soon as Berenger had
given his note to Smithers, and sent him off with a fisherman to
the THROSTLE, he took up his hat, and went out upon the beach, that
lay glistening in the morning sun, then turned straight towards the
tall spire of the church, with had been their last night's
guide.&nbsp; Philip caught his cloak.</p>

<p>'You are never going there, Berenger?'</p>

<p>'Vex me not now,' was all the reply he got.&nbsp; 'There the
dead and living meet together.'</p>

<p>'But, brother, they will take you for one of their own
sort.'</p>

<p>'Let them.'</p>

<p>Philip was right that it was neither a prudent nor consistent
proceeding, but Berenger had little power of reflection, and his
impulse at present bore him into the church belonging to his native
faith and land, without any defined felling, save that it was peace
to kneel there among the scattered worshippers, who came and went
with their fish-baskets in their hands, and to hear the low chant
of the priest and his assistant from within the screen.</p>

<p>Philip meantime marched up and down outside in much annoyance,
until the priest and his brother came out, when the first thing he
heard the good Colombeau say was, 'I would have called upon you
before, my son, but that I feared you were a Huguenot.'</p>

<p>'I am an English Protestant,' said Berenger; 'but, ah! sir, I
needed comfort too much to stay away from prayer.'</p>

<p>Pere Colombeau looked at him in perplexity, thinking perhaps
that here might be a promising convert, if there were only time to
work on him; but Berenger quitted the subject at once, asking the
distance to Lucon.</p>

<p>'A full day's journey,' answered Pere Colombeau, and added, 'I
am sorry you are indeed a Huguenot.&nbsp; It was what I feared last
night, but I feared to add to your grief.&nbsp; The nuns are not
permitted to deliver up children to Huguenot relations.'</p>

<p>'I am her father!' exclaimed Berenger, indignantly.</p>

<p>'That goes for nothing, according to the rules of the Church,'
said the priest.&nbsp; 'The Church cannot yield her children to
heresy.'</p>

<p>'But we in England and not Calvinists,' cried Berenger.&nbsp;
'We are not like your Huguenots.'</p>

<p>'The Church would make no difference,' said the priest.&nbsp;
'Stay, sir,' as Berenger stuck his own forehead, and was about to
utter a fierce invective.&nbsp; 'Remember that if your child lives,
it is owing to the pity of the good nuns.&nbsp; You seem not far
from the bosom of the Church.&nbsp; Did you but return---'</p>

<p>'It is vain to speak of that,' said Berenger, quickly.&nbsp;
'Say, sir, would an order from the King avail to open these
doors?'</p>

<p>'Of course it would, if you have the influence to obtain
one.'</p>

<p>'I have, I have,' cried Berenger, eagerly.&nbsp; 'The King has
been my good friend already.&nbsp; Moreover, my English grandfather
will deal with the Queen.&nbsp; The heiress of our house cannot be
left in a foreign nunnery.&nbsp; Say, sir,' he added, turning to
the priest, 'if I went to Lucon at once know your name, and refuse
all dealings with you.'</p>

<p>'She could not do so, if I brought an order from the King.'</p>

<p>'Certainly not.'</p>

<p>'Then to Paris!'&nbsp; And laying his hand on Philip's shoulder,
he asked the boy whether he had understood, ad explained that he
must go at once to Paris--riding post--and obtain the order from
the King.</p>

<p>'To Paris--to be murdered again!' said Philip, in dismay.</p>

<p>'They do not spend their time there in murder,' said
Berenger.&nbsp; 'And now is the time, while the savage villain
Narcisse is with his master in Poland.&nbsp; I cannot but go,
Philip; we both waste words.&nbsp; You shall take home a letter to
my Lord.'</p>

<p>'I--I go not home without you,' said Philip, doggedly.</p>

<p>'I cannot take you, Phil; I have no warrant.'</p>

<p>'I have warrant for going, though.&nbsp; My father said he was
easier about you with me at your side.&nbsp; Where you go, I
go.'</p>

<p>The brothers understood each other's ways so well, that Berenger
knew the intonation in Philip's voice that meant that nothing
should make him give way.&nbsp; He persuaded no more, only took
measures for the journey, in which the kind priest gave him
friendly advice.&nbsp; There was no doubt that the good man pitied
him sincerely, and wished him success more than perhaps he strictly
ought to have done, unless as a possible convert.&nbsp; Of money
for the journey there was no lack, for Berenger had brought a
considerable sum, intending to reward all who had befriended
Eustacie, as well as to fit her out for the voyage; and this,
perhaps, with his papers, he had brought ashore to facilitate his
entrance into La Sablerie,--that entrance which, alas! he had found
only too easy.&nbsp; He had therefore only to obtain horses and a
guide, and this could be done at la Motte-Achard, where the party
could easily be guided on foot, or conveyed in a boat if the fog
should not set in again, but all the coast-line of Nissard was
dangerous in autumn and winter; nay, even this very August an old
man, with his daughter, her infant, and a donkey, had been found
bewildered between the creeks on a sandbank, where they stood still
and patient, like a picture of the Flight into Egypt, when an old
fisherman found them, and brought them to the beneficent shelter of
the Presbytere.</p>

<p>Stories of this kind were told at the meal that was something
partaking of the nature of both breakfast and early dinner, but
where Berenger ate little and spoke less.&nbsp; Philip watched him
anxiously; the boy thought the journey a perilous experiment every
way, but, boyishly, was resolved neither to own his fears of it nor
to leave his brother.&nbsp; External perils he was quite ready to
face, and he fancied that his English birth would give him some
power of protecting Berenger, but he was more reasonably in dread
of the present shock bringing on such an illness as the last
relapse; and if Berenger lost his senses again, what should they
do?&nbsp; He even ventured to hint at this danger, but Berenger
answered, 'That will scarce happen again.&nbsp; My head is stronger
now.&nbsp; Besides, it was doing nothing, and hearing her truth
profaned, that crazed me.&nbsp; No one at least will do that
again.&nbsp; But if you wish to drive me frantic again, the way
would be to let Hobbs carry me home without seeking her child.'</p>

<p>Philip bore this in mind, when, with flood-tide, Master Hobbs
landed, and showed himself utterly dismayed at the turn affairs had
taken.&nbsp; He saw the needlessness of going to Lucon without
royal authority; indeed, he thought it possible that the very
application there might give the alarm, and cause all tokens of the
child's identity to be destroyed, in order to save her from her
heretic relations.&nbsp; But he did not at all approve of the young
gentlemen going off to Paris at once.&nbsp; It was against his
orders.&nbsp; He felt bound to take them home as he has brought
them, and they might then make a fresh start if it so pleased them;
but how could he return to my Lord and Sir Duke without them?&nbsp;
'Mr. Ribaumont might be right--it was not for him to say a father
ought not to look after his child--yet he was but a stripling
himself, and my Lord had said, "Master Hobbs, I trust him to
you."'&nbsp; He would clearly have liked to have called in a boat's
crew, mastered the young gentlemen, and carried them on board as
captives; but as this was out of his power, he was obliged to yield
the point.&nbsp; He disconsolately accepted the letters in which
Berenger had explained all, and in which he promised to go at once
to Sir Francis Walsingham's at Paris, to run into no needless
danger, and to watch carefully over Philip; and craved pardon, in a
respectful but yet manly and determined tone, for placing his duty
to his lost, deserted child above his submission to his
grandfather. Then engaging to look out for a signal on the coast if
he should said to Bordeaux in January, to touch and take the
passengers off, Captain Hobbs took leave, and the brothers were
left to their own resources.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.&nbsp; THE VELVET COACH</h3>

<p>No, my good Lord, Diana--</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL</p>

<p>A late autumn journey from the west coast to Paris was a more
serious undertaking in the sixteenth century than the good seaman
Master Hobbs was aware of, or he would have used stronger
dissuasive measures against such an undertaking by the two youths,
when the elder was in so frail a state of health; but there had
been a certain deceptive strength and vigour about young Ribaumont
while under strong excitement and determination, and the whole
party fancied him far fitter to meet the hardships than was really
the case.&nbsp; Philip Thistlewood always recollected that journey
as the most distressing period of his life.</p>

<p>They were out of the ordinary highways, and therefore found the
hiring of horses often extremely difficult.&nbsp; They had intended
to purchase, but found no animals that, as Philip said, they would
have accepted as a gift, though at every wretched inn where they
had to wait while the country was scoured for the miserable jades,
their proposed requirements fell lower and lower.&nbsp; Dens of
smoke, dirt, and boorishness were the great proportion of those
inns, where they were compelled to take refuge by the breaking down
of one or other of the beasts, or by stress of weather.&nbsp; Snow,
rain, thaw and frost alternated, each variety rendering the roads
impassable; and at the best, the beasts could seldom be urged
beyond a walk, fetlock-deep in mire or water.&nbsp; Worse than all,
Berenger, far from recovered, and under the heavy oppression of a
heartrending grief, could hardly fail to lose the ground that he
had gained under the influence of hope.&nbsp; The cold seemed to
fix itself on the wound on his cheek, terrible pain and swelling
set in, depriving him entirely of sleep, permitting him to take no
nourishment but fragments of soft crumbs soaked in wine or broth--
when the inns afforded any such fare--and rendering speech
excessively painful, and at last unintelligible.</p>

<p>Happily this was not until Philip and Humfrey both had picked up
all the most indispensable words to serve their needs, and storming
could be done in any language.&nbsp; Besides, they had fallen in at
La Motte-Achard with a sharp fellow named Guibert, who had been at
sea, and knew a little English, was a Norman by birth, knew who the
Baron de Ribaumont was, and was able to make himself generally
useful, though ill supplying the place of poor Osbert, who would
have been invaluable in the present predicament.&nbsp; Nothing was
so much dreaded by any of the party as that their chief should
become utterly unable to proceed.&nbsp; Once let him be laid up at
one of these little <i>auberges</i>, and Philip felt as if all
would be over with him; and he himself was always the most
restlessly eager to push on, and seemed to suffer less even in the
biting wind and sleet than on the dirty pallets or in the smoky,
noisy kitchens of the inns.&nbsp; That there was no wavering of
consciousness was the only comfort, and Philip trusted to prevent
this by bleeding him whenever his head seemed aching or heated; and
under this well-meant surgery it was no wonder that he grew weaker
every day, in spite of the most affectionate and assiduous watching
on his brother's part.</p>

<p>Nearly six weeks had been spent in struggling along the
cross-roads, or rather in endless delays; and when at last they
came on more frequented ways, with better inns, well-paved <i>
chaussees</i>, and horses more fit for use, Berenger was almost
beyond feeling the improvement.&nbsp; At their last halt, even
Philip was for waiting and sending on to Paris to inform Sir
Francis Walsingham of their situation; but Berenger only shook his
head, dressed himself, and imperatively signed to go on.&nbsp; It
was a bright morning, with a clear frost, and the towers and
steeples of Paris presently began to appear above the poplars that
bordered the way; but by this time Berenger was reeling in his
saddle, and he presently became so faint and dizzy, that Philip and
Humfrey were obliged to lift him from his horse, and lay him under
an elm-tree that stood a little back from the road.</p>

<p>'Look up, sir, it is but a league further,' quoth Humfrey; 'I
can see the roof of the big church they call Notre-Dame.'</p>

<p>'He does not open his eyes, he is swooning,' said Philip.&nbsp;
'He must have some cordial, ere he can sit his horse.&nbsp; Can you
think of no lace where we could get a drop of wine or strong
waters?'</p>

<p>'Not I, Master Philip. We passed a convent wall but now, but
'twas a nunnery, as good as a grave against poor travellers.&nbsp;
I would ride on, and get some of Sir Francis's folk to bring a
litter or coach, but I doubt me if I could get past the barrier
without my young Lord's safe-conduct.'</p>

<p>Berenger, hearing all, here made an effort to raise himself, but
sank back against Philip's shoulder.&nbsp; Just then, a trampling
and lumbering became audible, and on the road behind appeared first
three horsemen riding abreast, streaming with black and white
ribbons; then eight pair of black horses, a man walking at the
crested heads of each couple, and behind these a coach, shaped like
an urn reversed, and with a coronet on the top, silvered, while the
vehicle itself was, melon-like, fluted, alternately black, with
silver figures, and white with black landscapes; and with white
draperies, embroidered with black and silver, floating from the
windows.&nbsp; Four lacqueys, in the same magpie-colouring, stood
behind, and outriders followed; but as the cavalcade approached the
group by the road-side, one of the horsemen paused, saying lightly,
'Over near the walls from an affair of honour!&nbsp; Has he caught
it badly?&nbsp; Who was the other?'</p>

<p>Ere Guibert could answer, the curtains were thrust aside, the
coach stopped, a lady's head and hand appeared, and a female voice
exclaimed, in much alarm, 'Halt!&nbsp; Ho, you there, in our
colours, come here.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; My brother here?&nbsp;
Is he wounded?'</p>

<p>'It is no wound, Madame,' said Guibert, shoved forward by his
English comrades, 'it is M. le Baron de Ribaumont who is taken ill,
and--ah! here is Monsieur Philippe.'</p>

<p>For Philip, seeing a thick black veil put back from the face of
the most beautiful lady who had ever appeared to him, stepped
forward, hat in hand, as she exclaimed, 'Le Baron de
Ribaumont!&nbsp; Can it be true?&nbsp; What means this?&nbsp; What
ails him?'</p>

<p>'It is his wound, Madame,' said Philip, in his best French; 'it
has broken out again, and he has almost dropped from his horse from
<i>defaillance</i>.'</p>

<p>'Ah, bring him here--lay him on the cushions, we will have the
honour of transporting him,' cried the lady; and, regardless of the
wet road, she sprang out of the coach, with her essences in her
hand, followed by at least three women, two pages, and two little
white dogs which ran barking towards the prostrate figure, but were
caught up by their pages.&nbsp; 'Ah, cousin, how dreadful,' she
cried, as she knelt down beside him, and held her essences towards
him.&nbsp; Voice and scent revived him, and with a bewildered look
and gesture half of thanks, half of refusal, he gazed round him,
then rose to his feet without assistance, bent his head, and making
a sign that he was unable to speak, turned towards his horse.</p>

<p>'Cousin, cousin,' exclaimed the lady, in whose fine black eyes
tears were standing, 'you will let me take you into the city--you
cannot refuse.'</p>

<p>'Berry, indeed you cannot ride,' entreated Philip; 'you must
take her offer.&nbsp; Are you getting crazed at last?'</p>

<p>Berenger hesitated for a moment, but he felt himself again
dizzy; the exertion of springing into his saddle was quite beyond
him, and bending his head he submitted passively to be helped into
the black and white coach.&nbsp; Humfrey, however, clutched
Philip's arm, and said impressively, 'Have a care, sir; this is no
other than the fine lady, sister to the murderous villain that set
upon him.&nbsp; If you would save his life, don't quit him, nor let
her take him elsewhere than to our Ambassador's.&nbsp; I'll not
leave the coach-door, and as soon as we are past the barriers, I'll
send Jack Smithers to make known we are coming.'</p>

<p>Philip, without further ceremony, followed the lady into the
coach, where he found her insisting that Berenger, who had sunk
back in a corner, should lay his length of limb, muddy boots and
all, upon the white velvet cushions richly worked in black and
silver, with devices and mottoes, in which the crescent moon, and
eclipsed or setting suns, made a great figure.&nbsp; The original
inmates seemed to have disposed of themselves in various nooks of
the ample conveyance, and Philip, rather at a loss to explain his
intrusion, perched himself awkwardly on the edge of the cushions in
front of his brother, thinking that Humfrey was an officious,
suspicious fellow, to distrust this lovely lady, who seemed so
exceedingly shocked and grieved at Berenger's condition.&nbsp; 'Ah!
I never guessed it had been so frightful as this.&nbsp; I should
not have known him.&nbsp; Ah! had I imagined---'&nbsp; She leant
back, covered her face, and wept, as one overpowered; then, after a
few seconds, she bent forward, and would have taken the hand that
hung listlessly down, but it was at once withdrawn, and folded with
the other on his breast.</p>

<p>'Can you be more at ease?&nbsp; Do you suffer much?' she asked,
with sympathy and tenderness that went to Philip's heart, and he
explained.&nbsp; 'He cannot speak, Madame; the shot in his cheek'
(the lady shuddered, and put her handkerchief to her eyes) 'from
time to time cases this horrible swelling and torture.&nbsp; After
that he will be better.'</p>

<p>'Frightful, frightful,' she sighed, 'but we will do our best to
make up.&nbsp; You, sir, must be his <i>trucheman</i>.'</p>

<p>Philip, not catching the last word, and wondering what kind of
man that might be, made answer, 'I am his brother, Madame.'</p>

<p>'<i>Eh! Monsieur son frere</i>.&nbsp; Had <i>Madame sa mere</i>
a son so old?'</p>

<p>'I am Philip Thistlewood, her husband's son, at your service,
Madame,' said Philip, colouring up to the ears; 'I came with him
for he is too weak to be alone.'</p>

<p>'Great confidence must be reposed in you, sir,' she said, with a
not unflattering surprise.&nbsp; 'But whence are you come?&nbsp; I
little looked to see Monsieur here.'</p>

<p>'We came from Anjou, Madame.&nbsp; We went to La Sablerie,' and
he broke off.</p>

<p>'I understand.&nbsp; Ah! let us say no more!&nbsp; It rends the
heart;' and</p>

<p>again she wiped away tear.&nbsp; 'And now---'</p>

<p>'We are coming to the Ambassador's to obtain'--he stopped, for
Berenger gave him a touch of peremptory warning, but the lady saved
his embarrassment by exclaiming that she could not let her dear
cousin go to the Ambassador's when he was among his own
kindred.&nbsp; Perhaps Monsieur did not know her; she must present
herself as Madame de Selinville, <i>nee</i> de Ribaumont, a poor
cousin of <i>ce cher Baron</i>, 'and even a little to you, <i>M. le
frere</i>, if you will own me,' and she held out a hand, which he
ought to have kissed, but not knowing how, he only shook it.&nbsp;
She further explained that her brother was at Cracow with Monsieur,
now King of Poland, but that her father lived with her at her
hotel, and would be enchanted to see his dear cousin, only that he,
like herself, would be desolated at the effects of that most
miserable of errors.&nbsp; She had been returning from her Advent
retreat at a convent, where she had been praying for the soul of
the late M. de Selinville, when a true Providence had made her
remark the colours of her family.&nbsp; And now, nothing would
serve her, but that this dear Baron should be carried at once to
their hotel, which was much nearer than that of the Ambassador, and
where every comfort should await him.&nbsp; She clasped her hands
in earnest entreaty, and Philip, greatly touched by her kindness
and perceiving that every jolt of the splendid by springless
vehicle caused Berenger's head a shoot of anguish, was almost
acceding to her offer, when he was checked by one of the most
imperative of those silent negatives.&nbsp; Hitherto, Master
Thistlewood had been rather proud of his bad French, and as long as
he could be understood, considered trampling on genders, tenses,
and moods as a manful assertion of Englishry, but he would just now
have given a great deal for the command of any language but a
horseboy's, to use to this beautiful gracious personage.&nbsp; <i>
'Merci, Madame, nous ne fallons pas, nous avons passe notre parole
d'aller droit a l'Ambassadeur's et pas ou else</i>,' did not sound
very right to his ears ; he coloured up to the roots of his hair,
and knew that if Berry had had a smile left in him, poor fellow, he
would have smiled now.&nbsp; But this most charming and polite of
ladies never betrayed it, if it were ever such bad French; she only
bowed her head, and said something very pretty--if only he could
make it out --of being the slave of one's word, and went on
persuading.&nbsp; Nor did it make the conversation easier, that she
inquired after Berenger, and mourned over his injuries as if he
were unconscious, while Philip knew, nay, was reminded every
instant, that he was aware of all that was passing, most anxious
that as little as possible should be said, and determined against
being taken to her hotel.&nbsp; So unreasonable a prejudice did
this seem to Philip, that had it not been for Humfrey's words, he
would have doubted whether, in spite of all his bleeding, his
brother's brain were not wandering.</p>

<p>However, what with Humfrey without, and Berenger within, the
turn to the Ambassador's hotel was duly taken, and in process of
time a hearty greeting passed between Humfrey and the porter; and
by the time the carriage drew up, half the household were assembled
on the steps, including Sir Francis himself, who had already heard
more than a fortnight back from Lord Walwyn, and had become uneasy
at the non-arrival of his two young guests.&nbsp; On Smithers's
appearance, all had been made ready; and as Berenger, with feeble,
tardy movements, made courteous gestures of thanks to the lady, and
alighted form the coach, he was absolutely received into the
dignified arms of the Ambassador.&nbsp; 'Welcome, my poor lad, I am
glad to see you here again, though in such different guise.&nbsp;
Your chamber is ready for you, and I have sent my secretary to see
if Maitre Par be at home, so we will, with God's help, have you
better at ease anon.'</p>

<p>Even Philip's fascination by Madame de Selinville could not hold
out against the comfort of hearing English voices all round him,
and of seeing his brother's anxious brow expand, and his hand and
eyes return no constrained thanks.&nbsp; Civilities were exchanged
on both sides; the Ambassador thanked the lady for the assistance
she had rendered to his young friend and guest; she answered with a
shade of stiffness, that she left her kinsman in good hands, and
said she should send to inquire that evening, and her father would
call on the morrow; then, as Lady Walsingham did not ask her in,
the black and white coach drove away.</p>

<p>The lady threw herself back in one corner, covered her face, and
spoke no word.&nbsp; Her coach pursued its way through the streets,
and turned at length into another great courtyard, surrounded with
buildings, where she alighted, and stepped across a wide but dirty
hall, where ranks of servants stoop up and bowed as she passed;
then she ascended a wide carved staircase, opened a small private
door, and entered a tiny wainscoted room hardly large enough for
her farthingale to turn round in.&nbsp; 'You, Veronique, come
in--only you,' she said, at the door; and a waiting-woman, who had
been in the carriage, obeyed, no longer clad in the Angevin
costume, but in the richer and less characteristic dress of the
ordinary Parisian <i>femme de chambre</i>.</p>

<p>'Undo my mantle in haste!' gasped Madame de Selinville. 'O
Veronique--you saw--what destruction!'</p>

<p>'Ah! if my sweet young lady only known how frightful he had
become, she had never sacrificed herself,' sighed Veronique.</p>

<p>'Frightful!&nbsp; What, with the grave blue eyes that seem like
the steady avenging judgment of St. Michael in his triumph in the
picture at the Louvre?' murmured Madame de Selinville; then she
added quickly, 'Yes, yes, it is well.&nbsp; She and you, Veronique,
may see him frightful and welcome.&nbsp; There are other eyes--make
haste, girl.&nbsp; There--another handkerchief.&nbsp; Follow me
not.'</p>

<p>And Madame de Selinville moved out of the room, past the great
state bedroom and the <i>salle</i> beyond, to another chamber where
more servants waited and rose at her entrance.</p>

<p>'Is any one with my father?'</p>

<p>'No, Madame;' and a page knocking, opened the door and
announced, 'Madame la Comtesse.'</p>

<p>The Chevalier, in easy <i>deshabille</i>, with a flask of good
wine, iced water, and delicate cakes and <i>confitures</i> before
him, a witty and licentious epigrammatic poem close under his hand,
sat lazily enjoying the luxuries that it had been his daughter's
satisfaction to procure for him ever since her marriage.&nbsp; He
sprang up to meet her with a grace and deference that showed how
different a person was the Comtesse de Selinville from Diane de
Ribaumont.</p>

<p>'Ah! <i>ma belle</i>, my sweet,' as there was a mutual kissing
of hands, 'thou art returned.&nbsp; Had I known thine hour, I had
gone down for thy first embrace.&nbsp; But thou lookest fair, my
child; the convent has made thee lovelier than ever.'</p>

<p>'Father, who think you is here?&nbsp; It is he--the Baron.'</p>

<p>'The Baron?&nbsp; Eh, father!' she cried impetuously.&nbsp; 'Who
could it be but one?'</p>

<p>'My child, you are mistaken!&nbsp; That young hot-head can never
be thrusting himself here again.'</p>

<p>'But he is, father; I brought him into Paris in my coach!&nbsp;
I left him at the Ambassador's.'</p>

<p>'Thou shouldest have brought him here.&nbsp; There will be ten
thousand fresh imbroglios.'</p>

<p>'I could not; he is as immovable as ever, though unable to
speak!&nbsp; Oh, father, he is very ill, he suffers terribly.&nbsp;
Oh, Narcisse!&nbsp; Ah! may I never see him again!'</p>

<p>'But what brings him blundering her again?' exclaimed the
Chevalier.&nbsp; 'Speak intelligibly, child!&nbsp; I thought we had
guarded against that!&nbsp; He knows nothing of the
survivance.'</p>

<p>'I cannot tell much.&nbsp; He could not open his mouth, and his
half-brother, a big dull English boy, stammered out a few words of
shocking French against his will.&nbsp; But I believe they had
heard of <i>la pauvre petite</i> at La Sablerie, came over for her,
and finding the ruin my brother makes wherever he goes, are
returning seeking intelligence and succour for HIM.'</p>

<p>'That may be,' said the Chevalier, thoughtfully. 'It is well thy
brother is in Poland.&nbsp; I would not see him suffer any more;
and we may get him back to England ere my son learns that he is
here.'</p>

<p>'Father, there is a better way!&nbsp; Give him my hand.'</p>

<p><i>'Eh quoi</i>, child; if thou art tired of devotion, there are
a thousand better marriages.'</p>

<p>'No, father, none so good for this family.&nbsp; See, I bring
him all-- all that I was sold for.&nbsp; As the price of that, he
resigns for ever all his claims to the ancestral castle--to La
Leurre, and above all, that claim to Nid de Merle as Eustacie's
widower, which, should he ever discover the original contract, will
lead to endless warfare.'</p>

<p>'His marriage with Eustacie was annulled.&nbsp; Yet--yet there
might be doubts.&nbsp; There was the protest; and who knows whether
they formally renewed their vows when so much went wrong at
Montpipeau.&nbsp; Child, it is a horrible perplexity.&nbsp; I often
could wish we had had no warning, and the poor things had made off
together.&nbsp; We could have cried shame till we forced out a
provision for thy brother; and my poor little Eustacie---' He had
tears in his eyes as he broke off.</p>

<p>Diane made an impatient gesture.&nbsp; 'She would have died of
tedium in England, or broken forth so as to have a true
scandal.&nbsp; That is all over, father, now; weigh my
proposal!&nbsp; Nothing else will save my brother from all that his
cruel hand merits!&nbsp; You will win infinite credit at
court.&nbsp; The King loved him more than you thought safe.'</p>

<p>'The King has not a year to live, child, and he has personally
offended the King of Poland.&nbsp; Besides, this youth is
heretic.'</p>

<p>'Only by education.&nbsp; Have I not heard you say that he had
by an abjuration.&nbsp; And as to Monsieur's enmity, if it be not
forgotten, the glory of bringing about a conversion would end that
at once.'</p>

<p>'Then, daughter, thou shouldst not have let him bury himself
among the English.'</p>

<p>'It was unavoidable, father, and perhaps if he were here he
would live in an untamable state of distrust, whereas we may now
win him gradually.&nbsp; You will go and see him to-morrow, my dear
father.'</p>

<p>'I must have time to think of this thy sudden device.'</p>

<p>'Nay, he is in no condition to hear of it at present.&nbsp; I
did but speak now, that you might not regard it as sudden when the
fit moment comes.&nbsp; It is the fixed purpose of my mind.&nbsp; I
am no girl now, and I could act for myself if I would; but as it is
for your interest and that of my brother thus to dispose of me, it
is better that you should act for me.'</p>

<p>'Child, headstrong child, thou wilt make no scandal,' said the
Chevalier, looking up at his daughter's handsome head drawn up
proudly with determination.</p>

<p>'Certainly not, sir, if you will act for me.'&nbsp; And Diane
sailed away in her sweeping folds of black brocade.</p>

<p>In a few moments more she was kneeling with hands locked
together before a much-gilded little waxen figure of St. Eustacie
with his cross-bearing stag by his side, which stood in a curtained
recess in the alcove where her stately bed was placed.</p>

<p>'Monseigneur St. Eustache, ten wax candles everyday to your
shrine at Bellaise, so he recovers; ten more if he listen
favourably and loves me.&nbsp; Nay, all--all the Selinville jewels
to make you a shrine.&nbsp; All--all, so he will only let me love
him;' and then, while taking up the beads, and pronouncing the
repeated devotions attached to each, her mind darted back to the
day when, as young children, she had played unfairly, defrauded
Landry Osbert, and denied it; how Berenger, though himself
uninjured, had refused to speak to her all that day--how she had
hated him then--how she had thought she had hated him throughout
their brief intercourse in the previous year; how she had played
into her brother's hands; and when she thought to triumph over the
man who had scorned her, found her soul all blank desolation, and
light gone out from the earth!&nbsp; Reckless and weary, she had
let herself be united to M. de Selinville, and in her bridal
honours and amusements had tried to crowd out the sense of
dreariness and lose herself in excitement.&nbsp; Then came the
illness and death of her husband, and almost at the same time the
knowledge of Berenger's existence.&nbsp; She sought excitement
again that feverish form of devotion then in vogue at Paris, and
which resulted in the League.&nbsp; She had hitherto stunned
herself as it were with penances, processions, and sermons, for
which the host of religious orders then at Paris had given ample
scope; and she was constantly devising new extravagances.&nbsp;
Even at this moment she wore sackcloth beneath her brocade, and her
rosary was of death's heads. She was living on the outward husk of
the Roman Church not penetrating into its living power, and the
phase of religion which fostered Henry III. and the League offered
her no more.</p>

<p>All, all had melted away beneath the sad but steadfast glance of
those two eyes, the only feature still unchanged in the marred,
wrecked countenance.&nbsp; That honest, quiet refusal, that look
which came from a higher atmosphere, had filled her heart with
passionate beatings and aspirations once more, and more consciously
than ever.&nbsp; Womanly feeling for suffering, and a deep longing
to compensate to him, and earn his love, nay wrest it from him by
the benefits she would heap upon him, were all at work; but the
primary sense was the longing to rest on the only perfect truth she
had ever known in man, and thus with passionate ardour she poured
forth her entreaties to St. Eustache, a married saint, who had
known love, and could feel for her, and could surely not object to
the affection to which she completely gave way for one whose hand
was now as free as her own.</p>

<p>But St. Eustache was not Diane's only hope.&nbsp; That evening
she sent Veronique to Rene of Milan, the court-perfumer, but also
called by the malicious, <i>l'empoisonneur de le Reine</i>, to
obtain from him the most infallible charm and love potion in his
whole repertory.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.&nbsp; THE CHEVALIER'S EXPIATION</h3>

<p>Next, Sirs, did he marry?&nbsp;</p>

<p>And whom, Sirs, did he marry?&nbsp;</p>

<p>One like himself,</p>

<p>Though doubtless graced with many virtues, young,</p>

<p>And erring, and in nothing more astray</p>

<p>Than in this marriage.--TAYLOR, EDWIN THE FAIR.</p>

<p>Nothing could be kinder than the Ambassador's family, and Philip
found himself at once at home there, at least in his brother's
room, which was all the world to him.&nbsp; fortunately, Ambroise
Pare, the most skillful surgeon of his day, had stolen a day from
his attendance of King Charles, at St. Germain, to visit his Paris
patients, and, though unwilling to add to the list of cases, when
he heard from Walsingham's secretary who the suffer was, and when
injured, he came at once to afford his aid.</p>

<p>He found, however, that there was little scope for present
treatment, he could only set his chief assistant to watch the
patient and to inform him when the crisis should be nearer; but
remarking the uneasy, anxious expression in Berenger's eyes, he
desired to know whether any care on his mind might be interfering
with his recovery.&nbsp; A Huguenot, and perfectly trustworthy, he
was one who Walsingham knew might safely hear the whole, and after
hearing all, he at once returned to his patient, and leaning over
him, said, 'Vex not yourself, sir; your illness is probably serving
you better than health could do.'</p>

<p>Sir Francis thought this quite probable, since Charles was so
unwell and so beset with his mother's creatures that no open
audience could be obtained from him, and Pare, who always had
access to him, might act when no one else could reach him.&nbsp;
Meantime the Ambassador rejoiced to hear of the instinctive caution
that had made Berenger silence Philip on the object of the journey
to Paris, since if the hostile family guessed at the residence of
the poor infant, they would have full opportunity for obliterating
all the scanty traces of her.&nbsp; Poor persecuted little thing!
the uncertain hope of her existence seemed really the only thread
that still bound Berenger to life.&nbsp; He had spent eighteen
months in hope deferred, and constant bodily pain; and when the
frightful disappointment met him at La Sablerie, it was not wonder
that his heart and hope seemed buried in the black scorched ruins
where all he cared for had perished.&nbsp; He was scarcely
nineteen, but the life before him seemed full of nothing but one
ghastly recollection, and, as he said in the short sad little
letter which he wrote to his grandfather from his bed, he only
desired to live long enough to save Eustacie's child from being a
nameless orphan maintained for charity in a convent, and to see her
safe in Aunt Cecily's care; and then he should be content to have
done with this world for ever.</p>

<p>The thought that no one except himself could save the child,
seemed to give him the resolution to battle for life that often
bears the patient through illness, though now he as suffering more
severely and consciously than ever he had done before; and Lady
Walsingham often gave up hopes of him.&nbsp; He was tenderly cared
for by her and her women; but Philip was the most constant nurse,
and his unfailing assiduity and readiness amazed the household, who
had begun by thinking him ungainly, loutish, and fit for nothing
but country sports.</p>

<p>The Chevalier de Ribaumont came daily to inquire; and the first
time he was admitted actually burst into tears at the sight of the
swollen disfigured face, and the long mark on the arm which lay
half-uncovered.&nbsp; Presents of delicacies, ointments, and
cooling drinks were frequently sent from him and from the Countess
de Selinville; but Lady Walsingham distrusted these, and kept her
guest strictly to the regimen appointed by Pare.&nbsp; Now and
then, billets would likewise come.&nbsp; The first brought a vivid
crimson into Berenger's face, and both it and all its successors he
instantly tore into the smallest fragments, without letting any one
see them.</p>

<p>On the day of the Carnival, the young men of the household had
asked Master Thistlewood to come out with them and see the
procession of the <i>Boeuf Gras</i>; but before it could take
place, reports were flying about that put the city in commotion,
caused the Ambassador to forbid all going out, and made Philip
expect another Huguenot massacre.&nbsp; The Duke of Alencon and the
King of Navarre had been detected, it was said, in a conspiracy for
overthrowing the power of the Queen-mother, bringing in the
Huguenots, and securing the crown to Alencon on the King's
death.&nbsp; Down-stairs, the Ambassador and his secretaries sat
anxiously striving to sift the various contradictory reports;
up-stairs, Philip and Lady Walsingham were anxiously watching
Berenger in what seemed the long-expected crisis, and Philip was
feeling as if all the French court were welcome to murder one
another so that they would only let Ambroise Pare come to his
brother's relief.&nbsp; And it was impossible even to send!</p>

<p>At last, however, when Ash-Wednesday was half over, there was a
quiet movement, and a small pale man in black was at the bedside,
without Philip's having ever seen his entrance.&nbsp; He looked at
his exhausted patient, and said, 'It is well; I could not have done
you any good before.'</p>

<p>And when he had set Berenger more at ease, he told how great had
been the confusion at St. Germain when the plot had become known to
the Queen-mother.&nbsp; The poor King had been wakened at two
o'clock in the morning, and carried to his litter, when Pare and
his old nurse had tended him.&nbsp; He only said, 'Can they not let
me die in peace?' and his weakness had been so great on arriving,
that the surgeon could hardly have left him for M. de Ribaumont,
save by his own desire.&nbsp; 'Yes, sir,' added Pare, seeing
Berenger attending to him, 'we must have you well quickly; his
Majesty knows all about you, and is anxious to see you.'</p>

<p>In spite of these good wishes, the recovery was very slow; for,
as the surgeon had suspected, the want of skill in those who had
had the charge of Berenger at the first had been the cause of much
of his protracted suffering.&nbsp; Pare, the inventor of
trephining, was, perhaps, the only man in Europe who could have
dealt with the fracture in the back of the head, and he likewise
extracted the remaining splinters of the jaw, though at the cost of
much severe handling and almost intolerable pain: but by Easter,
Berenger found the good surgeon's encouragement verified, and
himself on the way to a far more effectual cure than he had
hitherto thought possible.&nbsp; Sleep had come back to him, he
experienced the luxury of being free from all pain, he could eat
without difficulty; and Pare, always an enemy to wine, assured him
that half the severe headaches for which he had been almost bled to
death, were the consequence of his living on bread soaked in sack
instead of solid food; and he was forbidden henceforth to inflame
his brain with anything stronger than sherbet.&nbsp; His speech,
too, was much improved; he still could not utter all the consonants
perfectly, and could not speak distinctly without articulating very
slowly, but all the discomfort and pain were gone; and though still
very weak, he told Philip that now all his course seemed clear
towards his child, instead of being like a dull, distraught
dream.&nbsp; His plan was to write to have a vessel sent from
Weymouth, to lie off the coast till his signal should be seen from
la Motte-Achard, and then to take in the whole party and the little
yearling daughter, whom he declared he should trust to no one but
himself.&nbsp; Lady Walsingham remonstrated a little at the
wonderful plans hatched by the two lads together, and yet she was
too glad to see a beginning of brightening on his face to make many
objections.&nbsp; It was only too sand to think how likely he was
again to be disappointed.</p>

<p>He was dressed, but had not left his room, and was lying on
cushions in the ample window overlooking the garden, while Frances
and Elizabeth Walsingham in charge of their mother tried to amuse
him by their childish airs and sports, when a message was brought
that M. le Chevalier de Ribaumont prayed to be admitted to see him
privily.</p>

<p>'What bodes that?' he languidly said.</p>

<p>'Mischief, no doubt,' said Philip Walsingham.&nbsp; 'Send him
word that you are seriously employed.'</p>

<p>'Nay, that could scarce be, when he must have heard the
children's voices,' said Lady Walsingham.&nbsp; 'Come away, little
ones.'</p>

<p>The ladies took the hint and vanished, but Philip remained till
the Chevalier had entered, more resplendent than ever, in a brown
velvet suit slashed with green satin, and sparkling with gold
lace--</p>

<p>-a contrast to the deep mourning habit in which Berenger was
dressed.&nbsp; After inquiries for his health, the Chevalier looked
at Philip, and expressed his desire of speaking with his cousin
alone.</p>

<p>'If it be of business,' said Berenger, much on his guard, 'my
head is still weak, and I would wish to have the presence of the
Ambassador or one of his secretaries.'</p>

<p>'This is not so much a matte of business as of family,' said the
Chevalier, still looking so uneasily at Philip that Berenger felt
constrained to advise him to join the young ladies in the garden;
but instead of doing this, the boy paced the corridors like a
restless dog waiting for his master, and no sooner heard the old
gentleman bow himself out than he hurried back again, to find
Berenger heated, panting, agitated as by a sharp encounter.</p>

<p>'Brother, what is it--what has the old rogue done to you?'</p>

<p>'Nothing,' said Berenger, tardily and wearily; and for some
minutes he did not attempt to speak, while Philip devoured his
curiosity as best he might.&nbsp; At last he said, 'He was always
beyond me.&nbsp; What think you?&nbsp; Now he wants me to turn
French courtier and marry his daughter.'</p>

<p>'His daughter!' exclaimed Philip, 'that beautiful lady I saw in
the coach?'</p>

<p>A nod of assent.</p>

<p>'I only wish it were I.'</p>

<p>'Philip,' half angrily, 'how can you be such a fool?'</p>

<p>'Of course, I know it can't be,' said Philip sheepishly, but a
little offended.&nbsp; 'But she's the fairest woman my eyes ever
beheld.'</p>

<p>'And the falsest.'</p>

<p>'My father says all women are false; only they can't help it,
and don't mean it.'</p>

<p>'Only some do mean it,' said Berenger, dryly.</p>

<p>'Brother!' cried Philip, fiercely, as if ready to break a lance,
'what right have you to accuse that kindly, lovely dame of
falsehood?'</p>

<p>'It skills not going through all,' said Berenger, wearily.&nbsp;
'I know her of old.&nbsp; She began by passing herself off on me as
my wife.'</p>

<p>'And you were not transported?'</p>

<p>'I am not such a gull as you.'</p>

<p>'How very beautiful your wife must have been!' said Philip, with
gruff amazement overpowering his consideration.</p>

<p>'Much you know about it,' returned Berenger, turning his face
away.</p>

<p>There was a long silence, first broken by Philip, asking more
cautiously, 'And what did you say to him?'</p>

<p>'I said whatever could show it was most impossible.&nbsp; Even I
said the brother's handwriting was too plain on my face for me to
offer myself to the sister.&nbsp; But it seems all that is to be
passed over as an unlucky mistake.&nbsp; I wish I could guess what
the old fellow is aiming at.'</p>

<p>'I am sure the lady looked at you as if she loved you.'</p>

<p>'Simpleton!&nbsp; She looked to see how she could beguile
me.&nbsp; Love!&nbsp; They do nothing for love here, you foolish
boy, save <i>par amour</i>.&nbsp; If she loved me, her father was
the last person she would have sent me.&nbsp; No, no; 'tis a new
stratagem, if I could only seen my way into it.&nbsp; Perhaps Sir
Francis will when he can spend an hour on me.'</p>

<p>Though full of occupation, Sir Francis never failed daily to
look in upon his convalescent guest, and when he heard of the
Chevalier's interview, he took care that Berenger should have full
time to consult him; and, of course, he inquired a good deal more
into the particulars of the proposal than Philip had done.&nbsp;
When he learnt that the Chevalier had offered all the very
considerable riches and lands that Diane enjoyed in right of her
late husband as an equivalent for Berenger's resignation of all
claims upon the Nid-de-Merle property, he noted it on his tables,
and desired to know what these claims might be.&nbsp; 'I cannot
tell,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'You may remember, sir, the parchments
with our contract of marriage had been taken away from Chateau
Leurre, and I have never seen them.'</p>

<p>'Then,' said the Ambassador, 'you may hold it as certain that
those parchments give you some advantage which he hears, since he
is willing to purchase it at so heavy a price.&nbsp; Otherwise he
himself would be the natural heir of those lands.'</p>

<p>'After my child,' said Berenger, hastily.</p>

<p>'Were you on your guard against mentioning your trust in your
child's life?' said Sir Francis.</p>

<p>The long scar turned deeper purple than ever.&nbsp; 'Only so far
as that I said there still be rights I had no power to resign,'
said Berenger.&nbsp; 'And then he began to prove to me---what I had
no mind to hear' (and his voice trembled) '---all that I know but
too well.'</p>

<p>'Hum! you must not be left alone again to cope with him,' said
Walsingham.&nbsp; 'Did he make any question of the validity of your
marriage?'</p>

<p>'No, sir, it was never touched on.&nbsp; I would not let him
take her name into his lips.'</p>

<p>Walsingham considered for some minutes, and then said, 'It is
clear, then, that he believes that the marriage can be sufficiently
established to enable you to disturb him in his possession of some
part, at least, of the Angevin inheritance, or he would not
endeavour to purchase your renunciation of it by the hand of a
daughter so richly endowed.'</p>

<p>'I would willingly renounce it if that were all!&nbsp; I never
sought it; only I cannot give up her child's rights.'</p>

<p>'And that you almost declared,' proceeded Walsingham; 'so that
the Chevalier has by his negotiation gathered from you that you
have not given up hope that the infant lives.&nbsp; Do your men
know where you believe she is?'</p>

<p>'My Englishmen know it, of course,' said Berenger; 'but there is
no fear of them.&nbsp; The Chevalier speaks no English, and they
scarcely any French; and, besides, I believe they deem him equally
my butcher with his son.&nbsp; The other fellow I only picked up
after I was on my way to Paris, and I doubt his knowing my
purpose.'</p>

<p>'The Chevalier must have had speech with him, though,' said
Philip; 'for it was he who brought word that the old rogue wished
to speak with you.'</p>

<p>'It would be well to be quit yourself of the fellow ere leaving
Paris,' said Walsingham.</p>

<p>'Then, sir,' said Berenger, with an anxious voice, 'do you
indeed think I have betrayed aught that can peril the poor little
one?'</p>

<p>Sir Francis smiled.&nbsp; 'We do not set lads of your age to
cope with old foxes,' he answered; 'and it seems to me that you
used far discretion in the encounter.&nbsp; The mere belief that
the child lives does not show him where she may be.&nbsp; In
effect, it would seem likely to most that the babe would be nursed
in some cottage, and thus not be in the city of La Sablerie at
all.&nbsp; He might, mayhap, thus be put on a false scent.'</p>

<p>'Oh no,' exclaimed Berenger, startled; 'that might bring the
death of some other person's child on my soul.'</p>

<p>'That shall be guarded against,' said Sir Francis.&nbsp; 'In the
meantime, my fair youth, keep your matters as silent as may be
---do not admit the Chevalier again in my absence; and, as to this
man Guibert, I will confer with my steward whether he knows too
much, and whether it be safer to keep of dismiss him!'</p>

<p>'If only I could see the King, and leave Paris,' sighed
Berenger.</p>

<p>And Walsingham, though unwilling to grieve the poor youth
further, bethought himself that this was the most difficult and
hopeless matter of all.&nbsp; As young Ribaumont grew better, the
King grew worse; he himself only saw Charles on rare occasions,
surrounded by a host of watchful eyes and ears, and every time he
marked the progress of disease; and though such a hint could be
given by an Ambassador, he thought that by far the best chance of
recovery of the child lay in the confusion that might probably
follow the death of Charles IX. in the absence of his next
heir.</p>

<p>Berenger reckoned on the influence of Elisabeth of Austria, who
had been the real worker in his union with Eustacie; but he was
told that it was vain to expect assistance from her.&nbsp; In the
first year of her marriage, she had fondly hoped to enjoy her
husband's confidence, and take her natural place in his court; but
she was of no mould to struggle with Catherine de Medicis, and
after a time had totally desisted.&nbsp; Even at the time of the
St. Bartholomew, she had endeavoured to uplift her voice on the
side of mercy, and had actually saved the lives of the King of
Navarre and Prince of Conde; and her father, the good Maximilian
II., had written in the strongest terms to Charles IX. expressing
his horror of the massacre.&nbsp; Six weeks later, the first hour
after the birth of her first and only child, she had interceded
with her husband for the lives of two Huguenots who had been taken
alive, and failing then either through his want of will or want of
power, she had collapsed and yielded up the endeavour.&nbsp; She
ceased to listen to petitions from those who had hoped for her
assistance, as if to save both them and herself useless pain, and
seemed to lapse into a sort of apathy to all public
interests.&nbsp; She hardly spoke, mechanically fulfilled her few
offices in the court, and seemed to have turned her entire hope and
trust into prayer for her husband.&nbsp; Her German confessor had
been sent home, and a Jesuit given her in his stead, but she had
made no resistance; she seemed to the outer world a dull, weary
stranger, obstinate in leading a conventual life; but those who
knew her best--and of these few was the Huguenot surgeon Pare--knew
that her heart had been broken two guilty lives, or to make her
husband free himself from his bondage to bloody counsels.&nbsp; To
pray for him was all that remained to her--and unwearied had been
those prayers.&nbsp; Since his health had declined, she had been
equally indefatigable in attending on him, and did not seem to have
a single interest beyond his sick chamber.</p>

<p>As to the King of Navarre, for whose help Berenger had hoped, he
had been all these months in the dishonourable thraldom of
Catherine de Medicis, and was more powerless than ever at this
juncture, having been implicated in Alencon's plot, and imprisoned
at Vincennes.</p>

<p>And thus, the more Berenger heard of the state of things, the
less hopeful did his cause appear, till he could almost have
believed his best chance lay in Philip's plan of persuading the
Huguenots to storm the convent.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.&nbsp; THE DYING KING</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Die in terror of thy guiltiness,</p>

<p>Dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death,</p>

<p>Fainting, despair, despairing yield thy breath</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING RICHARD III.</p>

<p>A few days later, when Berenger had sent out Philip, under the
keeping of the secretaries, to see the Queen-mother represent
Royalty in one of the grand processions of Rogation-tide, the
gentle knock came to his door that always announced the arrival of
his good surgeon.</p>

<p>'You look stronger, M. le Baron; have you yet left your
room?'</p>

<p>'I have walked round the gallery above the hall,' said
Berenger.&nbsp; 'I have not gone down-stairs; that is for
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'What would M. le Baron say if his chirurgeon took him not
merely down-stairs, but up on flight at the Louvre?'</p>

<p>'Ha!' cried Berenger; 'to the King?'</p>

<p>'It is well-nigh the last chance, Monsieur; the Queen-mother and
all her suite are occupied with services and sermons this week; and
next week private access to the King will be far more
difficult.&nbsp; I have waited as long as I could that you might
gain strength to support the fatigue.'</p>

<p>'Hope cancels fatigue,' said Berenger, already at the other end
of the room searching for his long-disused cloak, sword, gloves,
hat, and mask.</p>

<p>'Not the sword,' said Pare, 'so please you.&nbsp; M. le Baron
must condescend to obtain entrance as my assistant--the plain black
doublet--yes, that is admirable; but I did not know that Monsieur
was so tall,' he added, in some consternation, as, for the first
time, he saw his patient standing up at his full height--unusual
even in England, and more so in France.&nbsp; Indeed, Berenger had
grown during his year of illness, and being, of course, extremely
thin, looked all the taller, so as to be a very inconvenient
subject to smuggle into to palace unobserved.</p>

<p>However, Ambroise had made up his mind to the risk, and merely
assisted Berenger in assuming his few equipments, then gave him his
arm to go down the stairs.&nbsp; Meeting Guibert on the way,
Berenger left word with him that he was going out to take the air
with Maitre Pare; and on the man's offering to attend him, refused
the proposal.</p>

<p>Pare carriage waited in the court, and Berenger, seated in its
depths, rolled unseen through the streets, till he found himself at
the little postern of the Louvre, the very door whence he was to
have led off his poor Eustacie.&nbsp; Here Ambroise made him take
off his small black mask, in spite of all danger of his scars being
remarked, since masks were not etiquette in the palace, and,
putting into his arms a small brass-bound case of instruments,
asked his pardon for preceding him, and alighted from the
carriage.</p>

<p>This was Ambroise's usual entrance, and it was merely guarded by
a Scottish archer, who probably observed nothing.&nbsp; They then
mounted the stone stair, the same where Osbert had dragged down his
insensible master; and as, at the summit, the window appeared where
Berenger had waited those weary hours, and heard the first notes of
the bell of St.-Germain-l'Auxerrois, his breath came in such
hurried sobs, that Pare would fain have given him time to recover
himself, but he gasped, 'Not here--not here;' and Pare, seeing that
he could still move on, turned, not to the corridor leading to the
King's old apartments, now too full of dreadful associations for
poor Charles, but towards those of the young Queen.&nbsp; Avoiding
the ante-room, where no doubt waited pages, users, and attendants,
Pare presently knocked at a small door, so hidden in the
wainscoting of the passage that only a <i>habitue</i> could have
found it without strict search.&nbsp; It was at once opened, and
the withered, motherly face of an old woman, with keen black eyes
under a formal tight white cap, looked out.</p>

<p>'Eh!&nbsp; Maitre Pare,' she said, 'you have brought the poor
young gentleman?&nbsp; On my faith, he looks scarcely able to
walk!&nbsp; Come in, sir, and rest a while in my chamber while
Maitre Ambroise goes on to announce you to the King.&nbsp; He is
more at ease to-day, the poor child, and will relish some fresh
talk.'</p>

<p>Berenger knew this to be Philippe, the old Huguenot nurse, whom
Charles IX. loved most fondly, and in whom he found his greatest
comfort.&nbsp; He was very glad to sink into the seat she placed
for him, the only one is her small, bare room and recover breath
there while Pare passed on to the King, and she talked as one
delighted to have a hearer.</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, rest yourself--stay; I will give you a few spoonfuls
of the cordial potage I have here for the King; it will comfort
your heart.&nbsp; Ah! you have been cruelly mauled--but he would
have saved you if he could.'</p>

<p>'Yes, good mother, I know that; the King has been my very good
lord.'</p>

<p>'Ah! blessings on you if you say so from your heart, Monsieur;
you know me for one of your poor Reformed.&nbsp; And I tell you--I
who saw him born, who nursed him from his birth--that, suffer as
you may, you can never suffer as he does.&nbsp; Maitre Ambroise may
talk of his illness coming from blowing too much on his horn; I
know better.&nbsp; But, ah! to be here at night would make a stone
shed tears of blood.&nbsp; The Queen and I know it; but we say
nothing, we only pray.'</p>

<p>The sight of a Huguenot was so great a treat to the old woman in
her isolated life, that her tongue ran thus freely while Berenger
sat, scarce daring to speak or breathe in the strange boding
atmosphere of the palace, where the nurse and surgeon moved as
tolerated, privileged persons, in virtue of the necessity of the
one to the King--of the other to all the world.&nbsp; After all
brief interval Pare returned and beckoned to Berenger, who followed
him across a large state-bedroom to a much smaller one, which he
entered from under a heavy blue velvet curtain, and found himself
in an atmosphere heavy with warmth and perfume, and strangely
oppressed besides.&nbsp; On one side of the large fire sat the
young Queen, faded, wan, and with all animation or energy departed,
only gazing with a silent, wistful intentness at her husband.&nbsp;
he was opposite to her in a pillowed chair, his feet on a stool,
with a deadly white, padded, puffy cheek, and his great black eyes,
always prominent, now with a glassy look, and strained wide, as
though always gazing after some horrible sight.&nbsp; 'Madame la
Comtesse' stood in her old, wooden, automaton fashion behind the
Queen; otherwise, no one was present save Pare, who, as he held up
the curtain, stood back to let M. de Ribaumont advance.&nbsp; He
stood still, however, merely bowing low, awaiting an invitation to
come forward, and trying to repress the startled tear called up by
the very shock of pity at the mournful aspect of the young King and
Queen.</p>

<p>Elisabeth, absorbed in her husband, and indifferent to all
besides, did not even turn her head as he entered; but Charles
signed to him to approach, holding out a yellow, dropsical-looking
hand; and as he dropped on one knew and kissed it fervently, the
King said, 'Here he is, Madame, the Baron de Ribaumont, the same
whose little pleasure-boat was sucked down in our whirlpool.'</p>

<p>All Elisabeth's memories seemed to have been blotted out in that
whirlpool, for she only bowed her head formally, and gave no look
of recognition, though she, too, allowed Berenger to salute her
listless, dejected hand.&nbsp; 'One would hardly have known him
again,' continued the King, in a low husky voice; 'but I hope, sir,
I see you recovering.'</p>

<p>'Thanks, Sire, to Heaven's goodness, and to your goodness in
sparing to me the services of Maitre Pare.'</p>

<p>'Ah! there is none like Pare for curing a wound OUTSIDE,' said
Charles, then leant back silent; and Berenger, still kneeling, was
considering whether he ought to proffer his petition, when the King
continued, 'How fares your friend Sidney, M. le Baron?'</p>

<p>'Right well, Sire.&nbsp; The Queen has made him one of her
gentlemen.'</p>

<p>'Not after this fashion,' said Charles, as with his finger he
traced the long scar on Berenger's face.&nbsp; 'Our sister of
England has different badges of merit from ours for her good
subjects.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; what say they of us in England,
Baron?'</p>

<p>'I have lain sick at home, Sire, and have neither seen nor
heard,' said Berenger.</p>

<p>'Ah! one day more at Montpipeau had served your turn,' said the
King; 'but you are one who has floated up again.&nbsp; One--one at
least whose blood is not on my head.'</p>

<p>The Queen looked up uneasy and imploring, as Charles
continued:</p>

<p>'Would that more of you would come in this way!&nbsp; They have
scored you deep, but know you what is gashed deeper still?&nbsp;
Your King's heart!&nbsp; Ah! you will not come, as Coligny does,
from his gibbet, with his two bleeding hands.&nbsp; My father was
haunted to his dying day by the face of one Huguenot tailor.&nbsp;
Why, I see a score, night by night!&nbsp; You are solid; let me
feel you, man.'</p>

<p>'M. Pare,' exclaimed the poor Queen, 'take him away.'</p>

<p>'No, Madame,' said the King, holding tight in his hot grasp
Berenger's hand, which was as pale as his own, long, thin, and
wasted, but cold from strong emotion; 'take not away the only
welcome sight I have seen for well-nigh two years.'&nbsp; He
coughed, and the handkerchief he put to his lips had blood on it;
but he did not quit his hold of his visitor, and presently said in
a feeble whisper, 'Tell me, how did you escape?'</p>

<p>Pare, over the King's head, signed to him to make his narrative
take time; and indeed his speech was of necessity so slow, that by
the time he had related how Osbert had brought him safely to
England, the King had recovered himself so as to say, 'See what it
is to have a faithful servant.&nbsp; Which of those they have left
me would do as much for me?&nbsp; And now, being once away with
your life, what brings you back to this realm of ours, after your
last welcome?'</p>

<p>'I left my wife here, Sire.'</p>

<p>'Ha! and the cousin would have married her--obtained permission
to call himself Nid de Merle--but she slipped through his clumsy
fingers; did she not?&nbsp; Did you know anything of her,
Madame?'</p>

<p>'No,' said the Queen, looking up.&nbsp; 'She wrote to me once
from her convent; but I knew I could do nothing for her but bring
her enemies' notice on her; so I made no answer.'</p>

<p>Berenger could hardly conceal his start of indignation--less at
the absolute omission, than at the weary indifference of the
Queen's confession.&nbsp; Perhaps the King saw it, for he added,
'So it is, Ribaumont; the kindest service we can do our friends is
to let them alone; and, after all, it was not the worse for
her.&nbsp; She did evade her enemies?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Sire,' said Berenger, commanding and steadying his voice
with great difficulty, 'she escaped in time to give birth to our
child in the ruined loft of an old grange of the Templars, under
the care of a Huguenot farmer, and a pastor who had known my
father.&nbsp; Then she took refuge in La Sablerie, and wrote to my
mother, deeming me dead.&nbsp; I was just well enough to go in
quest of her.&nbsp; I came--ah!&nbsp; Sire, I found only charred
ruins.&nbsp; Your Majesty knows how Huguenot bourgs are dealt
with.'</p>

<p>'And she---?'</p>

<p>Berenger answered but by a look.</p>

<p>'Why did you come to tell me this?' said the King,
passionately.&nbsp; 'Do you not know that they have killed me
already?&nbsp; I thought you came because there was still some one
I could aid.'</p>

<p>'There is, there is, Sire,' said Berenger, for once interrupting
royalty.&nbsp; 'None save you can give me my child.&nbsp; It is
almost certain that a good priest saved it; but it is in a convent,
and only with a royal order can one of my religion either obtain
it, or even have my questions answered.'</p>

<p>'Nor with one in Paris,' said the King dryly; 'but in the
country the good mothers may still honour their King's hand.&nbsp;
Here, Ambroise, take pen and ink, and write the order.&nbsp; To
whom?'</p>

<p>'To the Mother Prioress of the Ursulines at Lucon, so please our
Majesty,' said Berenger, 'to let me have possession of my
daughter.'</p>

<p>'Eh! is it only a little girl?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Sire; but my heart yearns for her all the more,' said
Berenger, with glistening eyes.</p>

<p>'You are right,' said the poor King.&nbsp; 'Mine, too, is a
little girl; and I bless God daily that she is no son--to be the
most wretched thing the France.&nbsp; Let her come in,
Madame.&nbsp; She is little older than my friend's daughter.&nbsp;
I would show her to him.'</p>

<p>The Queen signed to Madame la Comtesse to fetch the child, and
Berenger added, 'Sire, you could do a further benefit to my poor
little one.&nbsp; One more signature of yours would attest that
ratification of my marriage which took place in your Majesty's
presence.'</p>

<p>'Ah! I remember,' said Charles.&nbsp; 'You may have any name of
mine that can help you to oust that villain Narcisse; only wait to
use it--spare me any more storms.&nbsp; It will serve your turn as
well when I am beyond they, and you will make your claim
good.&nbsp; What,' seeing Berenger's interrogative look, 'do you
not know that by the marriage-contract the lands of each were
settled on the survivor?'</p>

<p>'No, Sire; I have never seen the marriage-contract.'</p>

<p>'Your kinsman knew it well,' said Charles.</p>

<p>Just then, Madame la Comtesse returned, leading the little
Princess by the long ribbons at her waist; Charles bent forward,
calling, 'Here, <i>ma petite</i>, come here.&nbsp; Here is one who
loves thy father.&nbsp; Look well at him, that thou mayest know
him.'</p>

<p>The little Madame Elisabeth so far understood, that, with a
certain lofty condescension, she extended her hand for the stranger
to kiss, and thus drew from the King the first smile that Berenger
had seen.&nbsp; She was more than half a year older than the
Berangere on whom his hopes were set, and whom he trusted to find
not such a pale, feeble, tottering little creature as this poor
young daughter of France, whose round black eyes gazed wonderingly
at his scar; but she was very precocious, and even already too much
of a royal lady to indulge in any awkward personal observation.</p>

<p>By the time she had been rewarded for her good behaviour by one
of the dried plums in her father's comfit-box, the order had been
written by Pare, and Berenger had prepared the certificate for the
King's signature, according to the form given him by his
grandfather.</p>

<p>'Your writing shakes nearly as much as mine,' said the poor
King, as he wrote his name to this latter.&nbsp; 'Now, Madame, you
had better sign it also; and tell this gentleman where to find
Father Meinhard in Austria.&nbsp; He was a little too true for us,
do you see--would not give thanks for shedding innocent
blood.&nbsp; Ah!'--and with a gasp of mournful longing, the King
sank back, while Elisabeth, at his bidding, added her name to the
certificate, and murmured the name of a convent in Vienna, where
her late confessor could be found.</p>

<p>'I cannot thank you Majesty enough,' said Berenger; 'My child's
rights are now secure in England at least, and this'--as he held
the other paper for the King--'will give her to me.'</p>

<p>'Ah! take it for what it is worth,' said the King, as he
scrawled his 'CHARLES' upon it.&nbsp; 'This order must be used
promptly, or it will avail you nothing.&nbsp; Write to Ambroise how
you speed; that is, if it will bring me one breath of good
news.'&nbsp; And as Berenger kissed his hand with tearful,
inarticulate thanks, he proceeded, 'Save for that cause, I would
ask you to come to me again.&nbsp; It does me good.&nbsp; It is
like a breath from Montpipeau--the last days of hope--before the
frenzy--the misery.'</p>

<p>'Whenever your Majesty does me the honour---' began Berenger,
forgetting all except the dying man.</p>

<p>'I am not so senseless,' interrupted the King sharply; 'it would
be losing the only chance of undoing one wrong.&nbsp; Only,
Ribaumont,' he added fervently, 'for once let me hear that one man
has pardoned me.'</p>

<p>'Sire, Sire,' sobbed Berenger, totally overcome, 'how can I
speak the word?&nbsp; How feel aught but love, loyalty,
gratitude?'</p>

<p>Charles half smiled again as he said in sad meditation--'Ah! it
was in me to have been a good king if they had let me.&nbsp; Think
of me, bid your friend Sidney think of me, as I would have
been--not as I have been--and pray, pray for me.'&nbsp; Then hiding
his face in his handkerchief, in a paroxysm of grief and horror, he
murmured in a stifled tone, 'Blood, blood, deliver me, good
Lord!'</p>

<p>In effect, there was so sudden a gush of blood from mouth and
nose that Berenger sprang to his feet in dismay, and was <i>bona
fide</i> performing the part of assistant to the surgeon, when, at
the Queen's cry, not only the nurse Philippe hurried in, but with
her a very dark, keen-looking man, who at once began applying
strong essences to the King's face, as Berenger supported his
head.&nbsp; In a few moments Pare looked up at Berenger, and
setting him free, intimated to him, between sign and whisper, to go
into Philippe's room and wait there; and it was high time, for
though the youth had felt nothing in the stress of the moment, he
was almost swooning when he reached the little chamber, and lay
back in the nurse's chair, with closed eyes, scarcely conscious how
time went, or even where he was, till he was partly aroused by
hearing steps returning.</p>

<p>'The poor young man,' said Philippe's kind voice, 'he is
fainting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ah! no wonder it overcame any kind heart.'</p>

<p>'How is the King?' Berenger tried to say, but his own voice
still sounded unnatural and far away.</p>

<p>'He is better for the time, and will sleep,' said Pare,
administering to his other patient some cordial drops as he
spoke.&nbsp; 'There, sir; you will soon be able to return to the
carriage.&nbsp; This has been a sore trial to your strength.'</p>

<p>'But I have gained all--all I could hope,' said Berenger,
looking at his precious papers.&nbsp; 'But, alas! the poor
King!'</p>

<p>'You will never, never let a word of blame pass against him,'
cried Philippe earnestly.&nbsp; 'It is well that one of our people
should have seen how it really is with him.&nbsp; All I regret is
that Maitre Rene thrust himself in and saw you.'</p>

<p>'Who?' said Berenger, who had been too much engrossed to
perceive any one.</p>

<p>'Maitre Rene of Milan, the Queen-mother's perfume.&nbsp; He came
with some plea of bringing a pouncet-box from her, but I wager it
was as a spy.&nbsp; I was doing my best to walk him gently off,
when the Queen's cry called me, and he must needs come in after
me.'</p>

<p>'I saw him not,' said Berenger; 'perhaps he marked not me in the
confusion.'</p>

<p>'I fear,' said Pare gravely, 'he was more likely to have his
senses about him than you.&nbsp; M. le Baron; these bleedings of
the King's are not so new to us familiars to the palace.&nbsp; The
best thing now to be done is to have you to the carriage, if you
can move.'</p>

<p>Berenger, now quite recovered, stood up, and gave his warm
thanks to the old nurse for her kindness to him.</p>

<p>'Ah! sir,' she said, 'you are one of us.&nbsp; Pray, pray that
God will have mercy on my poor child!&nbsp; He has the truth in his
heart.&nbsp; Pray that it may save him at the last.'</p>

<p>Ambroise, knowing that she would never cease speaking while
there was any one to hear her, almost dragged Berenger out at the
little secret door, conveyed him safely down the stairs, and placed
him again in the carriage.&nbsp; Neither spoke till the surgeon
said, 'You have seen a sad sight, Monsieur le Baron: I need not bid
you be discreet.'</p>

<p>'There are some things that go too deep for speech,' sighed the
almost English Berenger; then, after a pause, 'Is there no hope for
him?&nbsp; Is he indeed dying?'</p>

<p>'Without a miracle, he cannot live a month.&nbsp; He is as truly
slain by the St. Bartholomew as ever its martyrs were,' said Pare,
moved out of his usual cautious reserve towards one who had seen so
much and felt so truly.&nbsp; 'I tell you, sir, that his mother
hath as truly slain her sons, as if she had sent Rene there to them
with his drugs.&nbsp; According as they have consciences and
hearts, so they pine and perish under her rule.'</p>

<p>Berenger shuddered, and almost sobbed, 'And hath he no better
hope, no comforter?' he asked.</p>

<p>'None save good old Flipote.&nbsp; As you heard, the
Queen-mother will not suffer his own Church to speak to him in her
true voice.&nbsp; No confessor but one chosen by the Cardinal of
Lorraine may come near him; and with him all is mere
ceremony.&nbsp; But if at the last he opens his ear and heart to
take in the true hope of salvation, it will be from the voice of
poor old Philippe.'</p>

<p>And so it was!&nbsp; It was Philippe, who heard him in the night
sobbing over the piteous words, 'My God, what horrors, what blood!'
and, as she took from his tear-drenched handkerchief, spoke to him
of the Blood that speaketh better things than the blood of Abel;
and it was she who, in the final agony, heard and treasured these
last words, 'If the Lord Jesus will indeed receive me into the
company of the blest!'&nbsp; Surely, never was repentance deeper
than that of Charles IX.--and these, his parting words, were such
as to inspire the trust that it was not remorse.</p>

<p>All-important as Berenger's expedition had been, he still could
think of little but the poor King; and, wearied out as he was, he
made very little reply to the astonished friends who gathered round
him on his return.&nbsp; He merely told Philip that he had
succeeded, and then lay almost without speaking on his bed till the
Ambassador made his evening visit, when he showed him the two
papers.&nbsp; Sir Francis could hardly believe his good fortune in
having obtained this full attestation of the marriage, and promised
to send to the English Ambassador in Germany, to obtain the like
from Father Meinhard.&nbsp; The document itself he advised Berenger
not to expose to the dangers of the French journey, but to leave it
with him to be forwarded direct to Lord Walwyn.&nbsp; It was most
important, both as obviating any dispute on the legitimacy of the
child, if she lived; or, if not, it would establish those rights of
Berenger to the Nid de Merle estates, of which he had heard from
the King.&nbsp; This information explained what were the claims
that the Chevalier was so anxious to hush up by a marriage with
Madame de Selinville.&nbsp; Berenger, as his wife's heir, was by
this contract the true owner of the estates seized by the Chevalier
and his son, and could only be ousted, either by his enemies
proving his contract to Eustacie invalid and to be unfulfilled, or
by his own voluntary resignation. &nbsp;The whole scheme was clear
to Walsingham, and he wasted advice upon unheeding ears, as to how
Berenger should act to obtain restitution so soon as he should be
of age, and how he should try to find out the notary who had drawn
up the contract.&nbsp; If Berenger cared at all, it was rather for
the sake of punishing and balking Narcisse, than with any desire of
the inheritance; and even for righteous indignation he was just now
too weary and too sad.&nbsp; He could not discuss his rights to Nid
de Merle, if they passed over the rights of Eustacie's child, round
whom his affection were winding themselves as his sole hope.</p>

<p>The next evening Pare came in quest of Berenger, and after a
calm, refreshing, hopeful Ascension-day, which had been a real balm
to the weary spirit, found him enjoying the sweet May sunshine
under a tree in the garden.&nbsp; 'I am glad to find you out of
doors,' he said;</p>

<p>'I fear I must hasten your departure.'</p>

<p>'I burn to lose no time,' cried Berenger.&nbsp; 'Prithee tell
them I may safely go!&nbsp; They all call it madness to think of
setting out.'</p>

<p>'Ordinarily it would be,' said Pare; 'but Rene of Milan has sent
his underlings to see who is my new, tall assistant.&nbsp; He will
report all to the Queen-mother; and though in this house you could
scarcely suffer personal harm, yet the purpose of your journey
might be frustrated, and the King might have to undergo another of
those <i>bourrasques</i> which he may well dread.'</p>

<p>'I will go this very night,' said Berenger, starting up; 'where
is Philip?--where is Sir Francis?'</p>

<p>Even that very night Pare thought not too soon, and the
Ascension-tide illuminations brought so many persons abroad that it
would be easy to go unnoticed; and in the general festivity, when
every one was coming and going from the country to gaze or worship
at the shrines and the images decked in every church, it would be
easy for the barriers to be passed without observation.&nbsp; Then
the brothers would sleep at a large hostel, the first on the road
to England, where Walsingham's couriers and guest always baited,
and the next morning he would send out to them their attendants,
with houses for their further journey back into Anjou.&nbsp; If any
enemies were on the watch, this would probably put them off the
scent, and it only remained further to be debated, whether the
Norman Guibert had better be dismissed at once or taken with
them.&nbsp; There was always soft place in Berenger's heart for a
Norman, and the man was really useful; moreover, he would certainly
be safer employed and in their company, than turned loose to tell
the Chevalier all he might have picked up in the Hotel
d'Angleterre.&nbsp; It was therefore decided that he should be the
attendant of the two young men, and he received immediate orders
that night to pack up their garments, and hold himself ready.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, before the hour of departure, Guibert had stolen
out, had an interview with the Chevalier de Ribaumont at the Hotel
de Selinville, and came back with more than one good French crown
in his pocket, and hopes of more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.&nbsp; THE ORPHANS OF LA SABLERIE</h3>

<p>The cream tarts with pepper in them.--ARABIAN NIGHTS.</p>

<p>Hope, spring, and recovery carried the young Baronde Ribaumont
on his journey infinitely better than his companions had dared to
expect.&nbsp; He dreaded nothing so much as being overtaken by
those tidings which would make King Charles's order mere waste
paper; and therefore pressed on with little regard to his own
fatigue, although happily with increasing strength, which carried
him a further stage every day.</p>

<p>Lucon was a closely-guarded, thoroughly Catholic city, and his
safe-conduct was jealously demanded; but the name of Ribaumont
silenced all doubt.&nbsp; 'A relation, apparently, of M. de Nid de
Merle,' said the officer on guard, and politely invited him to
dinner and bed at the castle; but these he thought it prudent to
decline, explaining that he brought a letter from the King to the
Mother Prioress.</p>

<p>The convent walls were pointed out to him, and he only delayed
at the inn long enough to arrange his dress as might appear to the
Abbess most respectful, and, poor boy, be least likely to startle
the babe on whom his heart was set.&nbsp; At almost every inn, the
little children had shrieked and run from his white and gashed
face, and his tall, lank figure in deep black; and it was very
sadly that he said to Philip, 'You must come with me.&nbsp; If she
turns from me as an ogre, your bright ruddy face will win her.'</p>

<p>The men were left at the inn with charge to let Guibert speak
for them, and to avoid showing their nationality.&nbsp; The three
months of Paris, and the tailors there, had rendered Philip much
less conspicuous than formerly; but still people looked at him
narrowly as he followed his brother along the street.&nbsp; The two
lads had made up their minds to encumber themselves with no nurses,
or womanfolk. &nbsp;The child should be carried, fondled, and fed
by her boy-father alone.&nbsp; He believed that, when he once held
her in his arms, he should scarcely even wish to give her up to any
one else; and, in his concentration of mind, had hardly thought of
all the inconveniences and absurdities that would arise; but,
really, was chiefly occupied by the fear that she would not at
first let him take her in his arms, and hold her to his heart.</p>

<p>Philip, a little more alive to the probabilities, nevertheless
was disposed to regard them as 'fun and pastime.'&nbsp; He had had
many a frolic with his baby-sisters, and this would be only a
prolonged one; besides, it was 'Berry's' one hope, and to rescue
any creature from a convent was a good work, in his Protestant
eyes, which had not become a whit less prejudiced at Paris.&nbsp;
So he was quite prepared to take his full share of his niece, or
more, if she should object to her father's looks, and he only
suggested halting at an old woman's stall to buy some sweetmeats by
way of propitiation--a proceeding which much amazed the gazing
population of Lucon.&nbsp; Two reports were going about, one that
the King had vowed a silver image of himself to St. Ursula, if her
Prioress would obtain his recovery by their prayers; the other that
he was going to translate her to the royal Abbey of Fontevrault to
take charge of his daughter, Madame Elisabeth.&nbsp; Any way, high
honour by a royal messenger must be intended to the Prioress, Mere
Monique, and the Luconnais were proud of her sanctity.</p>

<p>The portress had already heard the report, and opened her wicket
even before the bell could be rung, then eagerly ushered him into
the parlour, the barest and most ascetic-looking of rooms, with a
boarded partition across, unenlivened except by a grated hollow,
and the outer portion empty, save of a table, three chairs, and a
rugged woodcut of a very tall St. Ursula, with a crowd of pigmy
virgins, not reaching higher than the ample hem of her
petticoat.</p>

<p>'Did Aunt Cecily live in such a place as this?' exclaimed
Philip, gazing round; 'or do they live on the fat among down
cushions inside there?'</p>

<p>'Hush--sh,' said Berenger, frowning with anxiety; for a rustling
was heard behind the screen, and presently a black veil and white
scapulary appeared, and a sweet calm voice said, 'Peace be with
you, sir; what are your commands?'</p>

<p>Berenger bowed low, and replied, 'Thanks, reverend Lady; I bring
a letter from the King, to request your aid in a matter that
touches me nearly.'</p>

<p>'His Majesty shall be obeyed.&nbsp; Come you from him?'</p>

<p>He was forced to reply to her inquiries after the poor King's
health before she opened the letter, taking it under her veil to
read it; so that as he stood, trembling, almost sickening with
anxiety, and scarcely able to breathe, he could see nothing but the
black folds; and at her low murmured exclamation he started as if
at a cannon-shot.</p>

<p>'De Ribaumont!' she said; 'can it be--the child--of--of--out
poor dear little <i>pensionnaire</i> at Bellaise?'</p>

<p>'It is--it is!' cried Berenger.&nbsp; 'O Madame, you knew her at
Bellaise?'</p>

<p>'Even so,' replied the Prioress, who was in fact the Soeur
Monique so loved and regretted by Eustacie.&nbsp; 'I loved and
prayed for her with all my heart when she was claimed by the
world.&nbsp; Heaven's will be done; but the poor little thing loved
me, and I have often thought that had I been still at Bellaise when
she returned she would not have fled.&nbsp; But of this child I
have no knowledge.'</p>

<p>'You took charge of the babes of La Sablerie, Madame,' said
Berenger, almost under his breath.</p>

<p>'Her infant among those poor orphans!' exclaimed the Prioress,
more and more startled and amazed.</p>

<p>'If it be anywhere in this life, it is in your good keeping,
Madame,' said Berenger, with tears in his eyes.&nbsp; 'Oh! I
entreat, withhold her no longer.'</p>

<p>'But,' exclaimed the bewildered nun, 'who would you then be,
sir?'</p>

<p>'I--her husband--widower of Eustacie--father of her orphan!'
cried Berenger.&nbsp; 'She cannot be detained from me, either by
right or law.'</p>

<p>'Her husband,' still hesitated Monique.&nbsp; 'But he is
dead.&nbsp; The poor little one--Heaven have mercy on her
soul--wrote me a piteous entreaty, and gave large alms for prayers
and masses for his soul.'</p>

<p>The sob in his throat almost strangled his speech.&nbsp; 'She
mourned me to the last as dead.&nbsp; I was borne away senseless
and desperately wounded; and when I recovered power to seek her it
was too late!&nbsp; O Madame! have pity--let me see all she has
left to me.'</p>

<p>'Is it possible?' said the nun.&nbsp; 'We would not learn the
parentage of our nurslings since all alike become children of
Mother Church.'&nbsp; Then, suddenly bethinking herself, 'But,
surely, Monsieur cannot be a Huguenot.'</p>

<p>It was no doubt the first time she had been brought in contact
with a schismatic, and she could not believe that such respectful
courtesy could come from one.&nbsp; He saw he must curb himself,
and explain.&nbsp; 'I am neither Calvinist nor Sacrementaire,
Madame.&nbsp; I was bred in England, where we love our own
Church.&nbsp; My aunt is a Benedictine Sister, who keeps her rule
strictly, though her convent is destroyed; and it is to her that I
shall carry my daughter.&nbsp; Ah, Lady, did you but know my
heart's hunger for her!'</p>

<p>The Prioress, better read in the lives of the saints than in the
sects of heretics, did not know whether this meant that he was of
her own faith or not; and her woman's heart being much moved by his
pleadings, she said, 'I will heartily give your daughter to you,
sir, as indeed I must, if she be here; but you have never seen
her?'</p>

<p>'No; only her empty cradle in the burnt house.&nbsp; But I MUST
know her.&nbsp; She is a year old.'</p>

<p>'We have two babes of that age; but I fear me you will scarce
see much likeness in either of them to any one you knew,' said the
Prioress, thoughtfully.&nbsp; 'However, there are two girls old
enough to remember the parentage of their companions, though we
forbade them to mention it.&nbsp; Would you see them, sir?'</p>

<p>'And the infants, so please you, reverend Mother,' exclaimed
Berenger.</p>

<p>She desired him to wait, and after an interval of suspense there
was a pattering of little <i>sabots</i> behind the partition, and
through the grating he beheld six little girls in blue serge frocks
and tight white caps.&nbsp; Of the two infants, one with a puny,
wizen, pinched face was in the arms of the Prioress; the other, a
big, stout, coarse child, with hard brown cheeks and staring
black-eyes, was on its own feet, but with a great basket-work frame
round its head to save it from falls.&nbsp; There were two much
more prepossessing children of three or four, and two
intelligent-looking girls of perhaps eight and ten, to the elder of
whom the Prioress turned, saying, 'Agathe, I release you from my
command not to speak of your former life, and desire you to tell
this gentleman if you know who were the parents of these two little
ones.'</p>

<p>'Yes, reverend Mother,' said Agathe, readily; 'the old name of
Claire' (touching the larger baby) 'was Salome Potier: her mother
was the washerwoman; and Nannonciade, I don't know what her name
was, but her father worked for Maitre Brassier who made the
kettles.'</p>

<p>Philip felt relieved to be free from all doubt about these very
uninviting little ones, but Berenger, though sighing heavily, asked
quickly, 'Permit me, Madame, a few questions.--Little maid, did you
ever hear of Isaac Gardon?'</p>

<p>'Maitre Isaac!&nbsp; Oh yes, sir.&nbsp; We used to hear him
preach at the church, and sometimes he catechized us,' she said,
and her lip quivered.</p>

<p>'He was a heretic, and I abjure him,' added the other girl,
perking up her head.</p>

<p>'Was he in the town?&nbsp; What became of him?' exclaimed
Berenger.</p>

<p>'He would not be in the town,' said the elder girl.&nbsp; 'My
poor father had sent him word to go away.'</p>

<p>'<i>Eh quoi</i>?'</p>

<p>'Our father was Bailli la Grasse,' interposed the younger girl,
consequentially.&nbsp; 'Our names were Marthe and Lucie la Grasse,
but Agathe and Eulalie are much prettier.'</p>

<p>'But Maitre Gardon?' still asked Berenger.</p>

<p>'He ought to be take and burnt,' said the new Eulalie; 'he
brought it all on us.'</p>

<p>'How was it?&nbsp; Was my wife with him--Madame de
Ribaumont?&nbsp; Speak, my child.'</p>

<p>'That was the name,' said one girl.</p>

<p>'But Maitre Gardon had no great lady with him,' said the other,
'only his son's widow and her baby, and they lodged with Noemi
Laurent, who made the <i>patisserie</i>.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' cried Berenger, lighting up with the new ray of
hope.&nbsp; 'Tell me, my dear, that they fled with him, and
where.'</p>

<p>'I do not know of their going,' said Agathe, confused and
overborne by his eagerness.</p>

<p>'Curb yourself, sir,' said the Prioress, 'they will recollect
themselves and tell you what they can.'</p>

<p>'It was the little cakes with lemoned sugar,' suggested the
younger girl.&nbsp; 'Maitre Tressan always said there would be a
judgment on us for our daintiness.&nbsp; Ah! he was very cross
about them, and after all it was the Maitre of Lucon who ate
fifteen of them all at once; but then he is not a heretic.'</p>

<p>Happily for Berenger, Agathe unravelled this speech.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle Gardon made the sugar-lemoned cakes, and the Mayor
of Lucon, one day when he supped with us, was so delighted with
them that he carried one away to show his wife, and afterwards he
sent over to order some more.&nbsp; Then, after a time, he sent
secretly to my father to ask him if Maitre Gardon was there; for
there was a great outcry about the lemon cakes, and the Duke of
Alencon's army were coming to demand his daughter-in-law; because
it seems she was a great lady, and the only person who could make
the cakes.'</p>

<p>'Agathe!' exclaimed the Prioress.</p>

<p>'I understand,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'The Cure of Nissard told
me that she was traced through cakes, the secret of which was only
known at Bellaise.'</p>

<p>'That might be,' said Mere Monique.&nbsp; 'I remember there was
something of pride in the cakes of Bellaise, though I always tried
to know nothing of them.'</p>

<p>'Well, little one, continue,' entreated Berenger.&nbsp; 'You are
giving me life and hope.'</p>

<p>'I heard my father and mother talk about it,' said Agathe,
gaining courage.&nbsp; 'He said he knew nothing of great people,
and would give nobody up to the Catholics, but as to Maitre Isaac,
he should let him know that the Catholic army were coming, and that
it would be the better for us if we had no pastor within our walls;
and that there was a cry that his daughter's lemon cakes were made
by the lady that was lost.'</p>

<p>'And they escaped!&nbsp; Ah! would that I could thank the good
man!'</p>

<p>'Surely yes, sir, I never saw them again.&nbsp; Maitre Tressan
the elder prayed with us.&nbsp; And when the cruel soldiers came
and demanded the lady and Maitre Isaac, and all obstinate
Calvinists, our mayor and my father and the rest made answer that
they had no knowledge of the lady, and did not know where Maitre
Gardon was; and as to Huguenots, we were all one as obstinate as
the other, but that we would pay any fine within our means so they
would spare our lives.&nbsp; Then the man in the fine coat said, it
was the lady they wanted, not the fine; and a great deal he said
besides, I know not what but my father said, "It is our life's
blood that they want," and he put on his breastplate and kissed us
all, and went away.&nbsp; Then came horrible noises and firing of
cannon, and the neighbours ran in and said that the enemy were
battering down the old crumbly bit of wall where the monastery was
burnt; and just then our man Joseph ran back all pale, and staring
, to tell us my father was lying badly hurt in the street.&nbsp; My
mother hurried out, and locked the door to keep us from
following.'</p>

<p>The poor child broke down in tears, and her sister went
on.&nbsp; 'Oh, we were so frightened--such frightful sounds came
close, and people ran by all blood and shrieking--and there was a
glare in the sky-- and nobody came home--till at last it grew so
dreadful that we hid in the cellar to hear and see nothing.&nbsp;
Only it grew hotter and hotter, and the light through the little
grating was red.&nbsp; And at last there was a noise louder than
thunder, and, oh, such a shaking--for it was the house falling
down.&nbsp; But we did not know that; we tried to open the door,
and could not; then we cried and called for father and mother--and
no one heard--and we sat still for fear, till we slept--and then it
was all dark, and we were very hungry.&nbsp; I don't know how time
went, but at last, when I was daylight again, there was a talking
above, a little baby crying, and a kind voice too; and then we
called out, "Oh, take us out and give us bread."&nbsp; Then a face
looked down the grating.&nbsp; Oh, it was like the face of an angel
to us, with all the white hair flying round.&nbsp; It was the holy
priest of Nissard; and when one of the cruel men said we were only
little heretics who ought to die like rats in a hole, he said we
were but innocents who did not know the difference.'</p>

<p>'Ah! we did,' said the elder girl.&nbsp; 'You are younger,
sister, you forget more;' and then, holding out her hands to
Berenger, she exclaimed, 'Ah! sir, take us away with you.'</p>

<p>'My child!' exclaimed the Prioress, 'you told me you were happy
to be in the good course.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes!' cried the poor child; 'but I don't want to be
happy!&nbsp; I am forgetting all my poor father and mother used to
say.&nbsp; I can't help it, and they would be so grieved.&nbsp; Oh,
take me away, sir!'</p>

<p>'Take care, Agathe, you will be a relapsed heretic,' said her
sister, solemnly.&nbsp; 'For me, I am a true Catholic.&nbsp; I love
the beautiful images and the processions.'</p>

<p>'Ah! but what would our mother have said!' cried poor Agathe,
weeping more bitterly.</p>

<p>'Poor child, her old recollections have been renewed,' said the
Prioress, with unchanged sweetness; 'but it will pass.&nbsp; My
dear, the gentleman will tell you that it is as impossible for him
to take you as it is for me to let you go.'</p>

<p>'It is so, truly, little one,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'The only
little girl I cold have taken with me would have been my own;' and
as her eyes looked at him wistfully, he added, 'No doubt, if your
poor mother could, she would thank this good Mother-prioress for
teaching you to serve God and be a good child.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur speaks well and kindly,' said the Prioress; 'and now,
Agathe, make your curtsey, and take away the little ones.'</p>

<p>'Let me ask one question more, reverend Mother,' said
Berenger.&nbsp; 'Ah! children, did you ever see her whom you call
Isaac Gardon's daughter-in-law?'</p>

<p>'No, sir,' said the children; 'but mother did, and she promised
one day to take us to see the baby, for it was so pretty--so white,
that she had never seen the like.'</p>

<p>'So white!' repeated Berenger to himself; and the Prioress,
struck, perhaps, by the almost flaxen locks that sparsely waved on
his temples, and the hue of the ungloved hand that rested on the
edge of the <i>grille</i>, said, smiling, 'You come of a fair
family, Monsieur.'</p>

<p>'The White Ribaumonts,' said Berenger, 'and, moreover, my mother
was called the Swan of England; my little sisters have skins like
snow.&nbsp; Ah! Madame, though I have failed, I go away far happier
than if I had succeeded.'</p>

<p>'And reveal the true faith,' began the nun; but Philip in the
meantime was nudging his brother, and whispering in English, 'No
Popish prayers, I say!&nbsp; Stay, give these poor little prisoners
one feast of the sweetmeats we brought.'</p>

<p>Of this last hint Berenger was glad, and the Prioress readily
consented to a distribution of the dainties among the
orphans.&nbsp; He wished to leave a more lasting token of his
gratitude to the little maiden whose father had perhaps saved
Eustacie's life, and recollecting that he had about him a great
gold coin, bearing the heads of Philip and Mary, he begged leave to
offer it to Agathe, and found that it was received by good Mere
Monique almost in the light of a relic, as bearing the head of so
pious a queen.</p>

<p>Then, to complete Philip's disgust he said, 'I took with me my
aunt's blessing when I set out; let me take yours with me also,
reverend Mother.'</p>

<p>When they were in the street again, Philip railed at him as
though he had subjected himself to a spell.</p>

<p>'She is almost a saint,' answered Berenger.</p>

<p>'And have we not saints enough of our own, without running after
Popish ones behind grates? Brother, if ever the good old days come
back of invading France, I'll march straight hither, and deliver
the poor little wretches so scandalously mewed up here, and true
Protestants all the time!'</p>

<p>'Hush!&nbsp; People are noticing the sound of your English.'</p>

<p>'Let them!&nbsp; I never thanked Heaven properly before that I
have not a drop of French---'&nbsp; Here Berenger almost shook him
by the shoulder, as men turned at his broad tones and foreign
words, and he walked on in silence, while Berenger at his side felt
as one treading on air, so infinite was the burden taken off his
mind.&nbsp; Though for the present absolutely at sea as to where to
seek Eustacie, the relief from acquiescence in the horrible fate
that had seemed to be hers was such, that a flood of unspeakable
happiness seemed to rush in on him, and bear him up with a new
infusion of life, buoyancy, and thankfulness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.&nbsp; IN THE KING'S NAME</h3>

<p>&nbsp;'Under which king, Bezonian? speak or die.'</p>

<p>'Under King Harry.'</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
--KING HENRY IV.</p>

<p>'One bird in the hand is not always worth two in the bush,
assuredly,' said Philip, when Berenger was calm enough to hold
council on what he called this most blessed discovery; 'but where
to seek them?'</p>

<p>'I have no fears now,' returned Berenger.&nbsp; 'We have not
been bore through so much not to be brought together at last.&nbsp;
Soon, soon shall we have her!&nbsp; A minister so distinguished as
Isaac Gardon is sure to be heard of either at La Rochelle,
Montauban, or Nimes, their great gathering places.'</p>

<p>'For Rochelle, then?' said Philip.</p>

<p>'Even so.&nbsp; We will be off early to-morrow, and from thence,
if we do not find her there, as I expected, we shall be able to
write the thrice happy news to those at home.'</p>

<p>Accordingly, the little cavalcade started in good time, in the
cool of the morning of the bright long day of early June, while
apple petal floated down on them in the lanes like snow, and
nightingales in every hedge seemed to give voice and tune to
Berenger's eager, yearning hopes.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sound of horse's feet in the road before
them, and as they drew aside to make way, a little troop of
gendarmes filled the narrow lane.&nbsp; The officer, a rough,
harsh-looking man, laid his hand on Berenger's bridle, with the
words, 'In the name of the King!'</p>

<p>Philip began to draw his sword with one hand, and with the other
to urge his horse between the officer and his brother, but Berenger
called out, 'Back!&nbsp; This gentleman mistakes my person.&nbsp; I
am the Baron de Ribaumont, and have a safe-conduct from the
King.'</p>

<p>'What king?' demanded the officer.</p>

<p>'From King Charles.'</p>

<p>'I arrest you,' said the officer, 'in the name of King Henry
III, and of the Queen Regent Catherine.'</p>

<p>'The King dead?' Exclaimed Berenger.</p>

<p>'On the 30<sup>th</sup> of May.&nbsp; Now, sir.'</p>

<p>'Your warrant--your cause?' still demanded Berenger.</p>

<p>'There will be time enough for that when you are safely lodged,'
said the captain, roughly pulling at the rein, which he had held
all the time.</p>

<p>'What, no warrant?' shouted Philip, 'he is a mere robber!' and
with drawn sword he was precipitating himself on the captain, when
another gendarme, who had been on the watch, grappled with him, and
dragged him off his horse before he could strike a blow.&nbsp; The
other two English, Humfrey Holt and John Smithers, strong
full-grown men, rode in fiercely to the rescue, and Berenger
himself struggled furiously to loose himself from the captain, and
deliver his brother.&nbsp; Suddenly there was the report of a
pistol: poor Smithers fell, there was a moment of standing aghast,
and in that moment the one man and the two youths were each pounced
on by three or four gendarmes, thrown down and pinioned.</p>

<p>'Is this usage for gentlemen?' exclaimed Berenger, as he was
roughly raised to his feet.</p>

<p>'The King's power has been resisted,' was all the answer; and
when he would have been to see how it was with poor Smithers, one
of the men-at-arms kicked over the body with sickening brutality,
saying, 'Dead enough, heretic and English carrion!'</p>

<p>Philip uttered a cry of loathing horror, and turned white;
Berenger, above all else, felt a sort of frenzied despair as he
thought of the peril of the boy who had been trusted to him.</p>

<p>'Have you had enough, sir?' said the captain.&nbsp; 'Mount and
come.'</p>

<p>They could only let themselves be lifted to their horses, and
their hands were then set free to use their bridles, each being
guarded by a soldier on each side of him.&nbsp; Philip attempted
but once to speak, and that in English: 'Next time I shall take my
pistol.'</p>

<p>He was rudely silenced, and rode on with wide-open stolid eyes
and dogged face, steadfastly resolved that no Frenchman should see
him flinch, and vexed that Berenger had his riding mask on so that
his face could not be studied; while he, on his side, was revolving
all causes possible for his arrest, and all means of enforcing he
liberation, if not of himself at least of Philip and Humfrey.&nbsp;
He looked round for Guibert, but could not see him.</p>

<p>They rode on through the intricate lanes till the sun was high
and scorching, and Berenger felt how far he was from perfect
recovery.&nbsp; At last, however, some little time past noon, the
gendarmes halted at a stone fountain, outside a village, and
disposing a sufficient guard around his captives, the officer
permitted them to dismount and rest, while he, with the rest of the
troop and the horses, went to the village CABARET.&nbsp; Philip
would have asked his brother what it meant, and what was to be
done, but Berenger shook his head, and intimated that silence was
safest as present, since they might be listened to; and Philip, who
so much imagined treachery and iniquity to be the order of the day
in France that he was scarcely surprised at the present disaster,
resigned himself to the same sullen endurance.&nbsp; Provisions and
liquor were presently sent up from the inn, but Berenger could
taste nothing but the cold water of the fountain, which trickled
out cool and fresh beneath an arch surmounted by a figure of Our
Lady.&nbsp; He bathed his face and head in the refreshing spring,
and lay down on a cloak in the shade, Philip keeping a constant
change of drenched kerchiefs on his brow, and hoping that he slept,
till at the end to two or three hours the captain returned, gave
the word to horse, and the party rode on through intricate lanes,
blossoming with hawthorn, and ringing with songs of birds that
spoke a very different language now to Berenger's heart from what
they had said in the hopeful morning.</p>

<p>A convent bell was ringing to evensong, when passing its
gateway; the escort turned up a low hill, on the summit of which
stood a chateau, covering a considerable extent of ground, with a
circuit of wall, whitewashed so as perfectly to glare in the
evening sun; at every angle a round, slim turret, crowned by a
brilliant red-tiled extinguisher-like cap; and the whole surmounted
by a tall old keep in the centre.&nbsp; There was a square
projection containing an arched gateway, with heavy doorways, which
were thrown open as the party approached.&nbsp; Philip looked up as
he rode in, and over the doorway beheld the familiar fretted
shield, with the leopard in the corner, and <i>'A moi
Ribaumont'</i> round it.&nbsp; Could it then be Berenger's own
castle, and was it thus that he was approaching it?&nbsp; He
himself had not looked up; he was utterly spent with fatigue,
dejection, and the severe headache brought on by the heat of the
sun, and was only intent on rallying his powers for the crisis of
fate that was probably approaching; and thus scarcely took note of
the court into which he rode, lying between the gateway and the <i>
corps de logis</i>, a building erected when comfort demanded more
space than was afforded by the old keep, against which one end
leant; but still, though inclosed in a court, the lower windows
were small and iron-barred, and all air of luxury was reserved for
the mullioned casements of the upper storey.&nbsp; The court was
flagged, but grass shot up between the stones, and the trim air of
ease and inhabited comfort to which the brothers were used at home
was utterly wanting.&nbsp; Berenger was hustled off his horse, and
roughly pushed through a deep porch, where the first thing he heard
was the Chevalier de Ribaumont's voice in displeasure.</p>

<p>'How now, sir; hands off!&nbsp; Is this the way you conduct my
nephew?'</p>

<p>'He resisted, sir.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Berenger, advancing into the hall, 'I know not the
meaning of this.&nbsp; I am peacefully travelling with a passport
from the King, when I am set upon, no warrant shown me, my faithful
servant slain, myself and my brother, an English subject,
shamefully handled.'</p>

<p>'The violence shall be visited on whatever rascal durst insult a
gentleman and my nephew,' said the Chevalier.&nbsp; 'For release,
it shall be looked to; but unfortunately it is too true that there
are orders from the Queen in Council for your apprehension, and it
was only on my special entreaty for the honour of the family, and
the affection I bear you, that I was allowed to receive you here
instead of your being sent to an ordinary prison.'</p>

<p>'On what pretext?' demanded Berenger.</p>

<p>'It is known that you have letters in your possession from
escaped traitors now in England, to La Noue, Duplessis Mornay, and
other heretics.'</p>

<p>'That is easily explained,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'You know well,
sir, that they were to facilitate my search at La Sablerie.&nbsp;
You shall see them yourself, sir.'</p>

<p>'That I must assuredly do,' replied the Chevalier, 'for it is
the order of her Majesty, I regret to say, that your person and
baggage be searched;' then, as indignant colour rushed into
Berenger's face, and an angry exclamation was beginning, he added,
'Nay, I understand, my dear cousin, it is very painful, but we
would spare you as much as possible.&nbsp; It will be quite enough
if the search is made by myself in the presence of this gentleman,
who will only stand by for form's sake.&nbsp; I have no doubt it
will enable us quickly to clear up matters, and set you free
again.&nbsp; Do me the honour to follow me to the chamber destined
for you.'</p>

<p>'Let me see the order for my arrest,' said Berenger, holding his
head high.</p>

<p>'The English scruple must be gratified,' said the
Chevalier.&nbsp; And accordingly the gendarme captain unfolded
before him a paper, which was evidently a distinct order to arrest
and examine the person of Henri Beranger Eustache, Baron de
Ribaumont and Sieur de Leurre, suspected of treasonable
practices--and it bore the signature of Catherine.</p>

<p>'There is nothing here said of my step-father's son, Philip
Thistlewood, nor of my servant, Humfrey Holt,' said Berenger,
gathering the sense with his dizzy eyes as best he could.&nbsp;
'They cannot be detained, being born subjects of the Queen of
England.'</p>

<p>'They intercepted the justice of the King,' said the captain,
laying his hand on Philip's shoulder.&nbsp; 'I shall have them off
with me to the garrison of Lugon, and deal with them there.'</p>

<p>'Wait!' said the Chevalier, interposing before Berenger's
fierce, horror-struck expostulation could break forth; 'this is an
honourable young gentleman, son of a chevalier of good reputation
in England, and he need not be so harshly dealt with.&nbsp; You
will not separate either him or the poor groom from my nephew, so
the Queen's authority be now rightly acknowledged.'</p>

<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders, as if displeased; and the
Chevalier, turning to Berenger, said, 'You understand, nephew, the
lot of you all depends on your not giving umbrage to these officers
of her Majesty.&nbsp; I will do my poor best for you; but
submission is first needed.'</p>

<p>Berenger knew enough of his native country to be aware that <i>
la justice du Roi</i> was a terrible thing, and that Philip's
resistance had really put him in so much danger that it was needful
to be most careful not further to offend the functionary of
Government; and abhorrent as the proposed search was to him, he
made no further objection, but taking Philip's arm, lest they
should he separated, he prepared to follow wherever he was to be
conducted.&nbsp; The Chevalier led the way along a narrow stone
passage, with loophole-windows here and there; and Philip, for all
his proud, indifferent bearing, felt his flesh creep as he looked
for a stair descending into the bowels of the earth.&nbsp; A stair
there was, but it went up instead of down, and after mounting this,
and going through a sort of ante-room, a door was opened into a
tolerably spacious apartment, evidently in the old keep; for the
two windows on opposite sides were in an immensely massive wall,
and the floor above and vaulting below were of stone; but otherwise
there was nothing repulsive in the appearance of the room.&nbsp;
There was a wood fire on the hearth; the sun, setting far to the
north, peeped in aslant at one window; a mat was on the floor,
tapestry on the lower part of the walls; a table and chairs, and a
walnut chest, with a chess-board and a few books on it, were as
much furniture as was to be seen in almost any living-room of the
day.&nbsp; Humfrey and Guibert, too, were already there, with the
small riding valises they and poor Smithers had had in
charge.&nbsp; These were at one opened, but contained merely
clothes and linen, nothing else that was noticed, except three
books, at which the captain looked with a stupid air; and the
Chevalier did not seem capable of discovering more than that all
three were Latin--one, he believed, the Bible.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, the Vulgate--a copy older than the Reformation, so
not liable to be called an heretical version,' said Berenger, to
whom a copy had been given by Lady Walwyn, as more likely to be
saved if his baggage were searched.&nbsp; 'The other is the Office
and Psalter after our English rite; and this last is not mine, but
Mr.&nbsp; Sidney's--a copy of Virgilius Maro, which he had left
behind at Paris.'</p>

<p>The Chevalier, not willing to confess that he had taken the
English Prayer-book for Latin, hastily said, 'Nothing wrong
there--no, no, nothing that will hurt the State; may it only be so
with what you carry on your person, fair cousin.&nbsp; Stand back,
gentleman, this is gear for myself alone.&nbsp; Now, fair nephew,'
he added, 'not a hand shall be laid on you, if you will give me
your honourable word, as a nobleman, that you are laying before me
all that you carry about you.'</p>

<p>An instant's thought convinced Berenger that resistance would
save nothing, and merely lead to indignity to himself and danger to
Philip; and therefore he gave the promise to show everything about
him, without compulsion.&nbsp; Accordingly, he produced his purse
for current expenses, poor King Charles's safe-conduct, and other
articles of no consequence, from his pockets; then reluctantly
opened his doublet, and took off the belt containing his store of
gold, which had been replenished at Walsingham's.&nbsp; This was
greedily eyed by the captain, but the Chevalier at once made it
over to Philip's keeping, graciously saying, 'We do no more than
duty requires;' but at the same time he made a gesture towards
another small purse that hung round Berenger's neck by a black
ribbon.</p>

<p>'On my sacred word and honour,' said Berenger, 'it contains
nothing important to any save myself.'</p>

<p>'Alas! my bounden duty,' urged the Chevalier.</p>

<p>An angry reply died on Berenger's lip.&nbsp; At the thought of
Philip, he opened the purse, and held out the contents on his palm:
a tiny gold ring, a tress of black hair, a fragment of
carnation-ribbon pricked with pin-holes, a string of small
worthless yellow shells, and, threaded with them, a large
pear-shaped pearl of countless price.&nbsp; Even the Chevalier was
touched at the sight of this treasury, resting on the blanched palm
of the thin, trembling hand, and jealously watched by eyes
glistening with sudden moisture, though the lips were firm
set.&nbsp; 'Alas! my poor young cousin,' he said, 'you loved her
well.'</p>

<p>'Not loved, but love,' muttered Berenger to himself, as if
having recourse to the only cordial that could support him through
the present suffering; and he was closing his fingers again over
his precious hoard, when the Chevalier added, 'Stay! Nephew--that
pearl?'</p>

<p>'Is one of the chaplet; the token she sent to England,' he
answered.</p>

<p>'<i>Pauvre petite!&nbsp;</i> Then, at least a fragment remains
of the reward of our ancestor's courage,' said the Chevalier.</p>

<p>And Berenger did not feel it needful to yield up that still
better possession, stored within his heart, that <i>la petite</i>
and her pearls were safe together.&nbsp; It was less unendurable to
produce the leather case from a secret pocket within his doublet,
since, unwilling as he was that any eye should scan the letters it
contained, there was nothing in them that could give any clue
towards tracing her.&nbsp; Nothing had been written or received
since his interview with the children at Lucon.&nbsp; There was,
indeed, Eustacie's letter to his mother, a few received at Paris
from Lord Walwyn, reluctantly consenting to his journey in quest of
his child, his English passport, the unfortunate letters to La
Noue; and what evidently startled the Chevalier more than all the
rest, the copy of the certificate of the ratification of the
marriage; but his consternation was so arranged as to appear to be
all on behalf of his young kinsman.&nbsp; 'This is serious!' he
said, striking his forehead; 'you will be accused of forging the
late King's name.'</p>

<p>'This is but a copy,' said Berenger, pointing to the heading;
'the original has been sent with our Ambassador's dispatches to
England.'</p>

<p>'It is a pity,' said the Chevalier, looking thoroughly vexed,
'that you should have brought fresh difficulties on yourself for a
mere piece of waste paper to be affected by the validity of your
marriage.&nbsp; Dear cousin,'--he glanced at the officer and
lowered his voice,--'let me tear this paper; it would only do you
harm, and the Papal decree annuls it.'</p>

<p>'I have given my word,' said Berenger, 'that all that could do
me harm should be delivered up!&nbsp; Besides,' he added, 'even had
I the feeling for my own honour and that of my wife and child,
living or dead, the harm, it seems to me, would be to those who
withhold her lands from me.'</p>

<p>'Ah, fair nephew! you have fallen among designing persons who
have filled your head with absurd claims; but I will not argue the
point now, since it becomes a family, not a State matter.&nbsp;
These papers'--and he took them into his hand--'must be examined,
and to-morrow Captain Delarue will take them to Paris, with any
explanation you may desire to offer.&nbsp; Meantime you and your
companions remain my guest, at full liberty, provided you will give
me your parole to attempt no escape.'</p>

<p>'No, sir,' said Berenger, hotly, 'we will not become our own
jailers, nor acquiesce in this unjust detention.&nbsp; I warn you
that I am a naturalized Englishman, acknowledged by the Queen as my
grandfather's heir, and the English Ambassador will inform the
court what Queen Elizabeth thinks of such dealings with her
subjects.'</p>

<p>'Well said,' exclaimed Philip, and drawing himself up, he added,
'I refuse my parole, and warn you that it is at your peril that you
imprison an Englishman.'</p>

<p>'Very well, gentlemen,' said the Chevalier; 'the difference will
be that I shall unwillingly be forced to let Captain Delarue post
guards at the outlets of this tower.&nbsp; A room beneath is
prepared for your grooms, and the court is likewise free to
you.&nbsp; I will endeavour to make your detention as little
irksome as you will permit, and meantime allow me to show you your
sleeping chamber.'&nbsp; He then politely, as if he had been
ushering a prince to his apartment, led the way, pointing to the
door through which they had entered the keep, and saying, 'This is
the only present communication with the dwelling-house.&nbsp; Two
gendarmes will always be on the outside.'&nbsp; He conducted the
young men up a stone spiral stair to another room, over that which
they had already seen, and furnished as fairly as ordinary sleeping
chambers were wont to be.</p>

<p>Here, said their compulsory host, he would leave them to prepare
for supper, when they would do him the honour to join him in the
eating-hall on their summons by the steward.</p>

<p>His departing bow was duly returned by Berenger, but no sooner
did his steps die away on the stairs than the young man threw
himself down on his bed, in a paroxysm of suffering both mental and
bodily.</p>

<p>'Berry, Berry, what is this?&nbsp; Speak to me.&nbsp; What does
it all mean?' cried Philip.</p>

<p>'How can I tell?' said Berenger, showing his face for a moment,
covered with tears; 'only that my only friend is dead, and some
villainous trick has seized me, just--just as I might have found
her.&nbsp; And I've been the death of my poor groom, and got you
into the power of these vile dastards!&nbsp; Oh, would that I had
come alone!&nbsp; Would that they had had the sense to aim
direct!'</p>

<p>'Brother, brother, anything but this!' cried Philip.&nbsp; 'The
rogues are not worth it.&nbsp; Sir Francis will have us out in no
time, or know the reason why.&nbsp; I'd scorn to let them wring a
tear from me.'</p>

<p>'I hope they never may, dear Phil, nor anything worse.'</p>

<p>'Now,' continued Philip, 'the way will be to go down to supper,
since they will have it so, and sit and eat at one's ease as if one
cared for them no more than cat and dog.&nbsp; Hark! there's the
steward speaking to Guibert.&nbsp; Come, Berry, wash your face and
come.'</p>

<p>'I--my head aches far too much, were there nothing else.'</p>

<p>'What! it is nothing but the sun,' said Philip.&nbsp; 'Put a
bold face on it, man, and show them how little you heed.'</p>

<p>'How LITTLE I heed!' bitterly repeated Berenger, turning his
face away, utterly unnerved between disappointment, fatigue, and
pain; and Philip at that moment had little mercy.&nbsp; Dismayed
and vaguely terrified, yet too resolute in national pride to betray
his own feelings, he gave vent to his vexation by impatience with a
temperament more visibly sensitive than his own:&nbsp; 'I never
thought you so mere a Frenchman,' he said contemptuously.&nbsp; 'If
you weep and wail so like a sick wench, they will soon have their
will of you!&nbsp; I'd have let them kill me before they searched
me.'</p>

<p>''Tis bad enough without this from you, Phil,' said Berenger,
faintly, for he was far too much spent for resentment or
self-defence, and had only kept up before the Chevalier by dint of
strong effort.&nbsp; Philip was somewhat aghast, both at the
involuntary gesture of pain, and at finding there was not even
spirit to be angry with him: but his very dismay served at the
moment only to feed his displeasure; and he tramped off in his
heavy boots, which he chose to wear as a proof of disdain for his
companions.&nbsp; He explained that M. de Ribaumont was too much
fatigued to come to supper, and he was accordingly marched along
the corridor, with the steward before him bearing a lighted torch,
and two gendarmes with halberds behind him.&nbsp; And in his walk
he had ample time for, first, the resolution that illness, and not
dejection, should have all the credit of Berenger's absence; then
for recollecting of how short standing had been his brother's
convalescence; and lastly, for a fury of self-execration for his
own unkindness, rude taunts, and neglect of the recurring
illness.&nbsp; He would have turned about and gone back at once,
but the two gendarmes were close behind, and he knew Humfrey would
attend to his brother; so he walked on to the hall--a handsome
chamber, hung with armour and spoils of hunting, with a few
pictures on the panels, and a great carved music-gallery at one
end.&nbsp; The table was laid out somewhat luxuriously for four,
according to the innovation which was beginning to separate the
meals of the grandees from those of their household.</p>

<p>Great concern was expressed by the Chevalier, as Philip, in
French, much improved since the time of his conversation with
Madame de Selinville, spoke of his brother's indisposition, saying
with emphasis, as he glared at Captain Delarue, that Maitre Pare
had forbidden all exposure to mid-day heat, and that all their
journeys had been made in morning or evening coolness.&nbsp; 'My
young friend,' as his host called him, 'should, he was assured,
have mentioned this, since Captain Delarue had no desire but to
make his situation as little painful as possible.'&nbsp; And the
Chevalier sent his steward at once to offer everything the house
contained that his prisoner could relish for supper; and then
anxiously questioned Philip on his health and diet, obtaining very
short and glum answers.&nbsp; The Chevalier and the captain glanced
at each other with little shrugs; and Philip, becoming conscious of
his shock hair, splashed doublet, and dirty boots, had vague doubts
whether his English dignity were not being regarded as English
lubberliness; but, of course, he hated the two Frenchmen all the
more, and received their civility with greater gruffness.&nbsp;
They asked him the present object of his journey--though, probably,
the Chevalier knew it before, and he told of the hope that they had
of finding the child at Lucon.</p>

<p>'Vain, of course?' said the Chevalier.&nbsp; 'Poor infant!&nbsp;
It is well for itself, as for the rest of us, that its troubles
were ended long ago.'</p>

<p>Philip started indignantly.</p>

<p>'Does your brother still nurture any vain hope?' said the
Chevalier.</p>

<p>'Not vain, I trust,' said Philip.</p>

<p>'Indeed!&nbsp; Who can foolishly have so inspired him with a
hope that merely wears out his youth, and leads him into
danger?'</p>

<p>Philip held his tongue, resolved to be impenetrable; and he was
so far successful, that the Chevalier merely became convinced that
the brothers were not simply riding to La Rochelle to embark for
England, but had some hope and purpose in view; though as to what
that might be, Philip's bluff replies and stubborn silence were
baffling.</p>

<p>After the meal, the Chevalier insisted on coming to see how his
guest fared; and Philip could not prevent him.&nbsp; They found
Berenger sitting on the side of his bed, having evidently just
started up on hearing their approach.&nbsp; Otherwise he did not
seem to have moved since Philip left him; he had not attempted to
undress; and Humfrey told Philip that not a word had been extracted
from him, but commands to let him alone.</p>

<p>However, he had rallied his forces to meet the Chevalier, and
answered manfully to his excuses for the broiling ride to which he
had been exposed, that it mattered not, the effect would pass, it
was a mere chance; and refused all offers of medicaments, potions,
and TISANES, till his host at length left the room with a most
correct exchange of good nights.</p>

<p>'Berry, Berry, what a brute I have been!' cried Philip.</p>

<p>'Foolish lad!' and Berenger half smiled.&nbsp; 'Now help me to
bed, for the room turns round!'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.&nbsp; CAGED IN THE BLACKBIRD'S NEST</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him shun castles;</p>

<p>Safer shall he be on the sandy plain</p>

<p>Than where castles mounted stand.--KING HENRY VI.</p>

<p>While Berenger slept a heavy morning's sleep after a restless
night, Philip explored the narrow domain above and below.&nbsp; The
keep and its little court had evidently been the original castle,
built when the oddly-nicknamed Fulkes and Geoffreys of Anjou had
been at daggers drawn with the Dukes of Normandy and Brittany, but
it had since, like most other such ancient feudal fortresses,
become the nucleus of walls and buildings for use, defence, or
ornament, that lay beneath him like a spider's web, when he had
gained the roof of the keep, garnished with pepper-box turrets at
each of the four angles.&nbsp; Beyond lay the green copses and
orchards of the Bocage, for it was true, as he had at first
suspected, that this was the chateau de Nid de Merle, and that
Berenger was a captive in his wife's own castle.</p>

<p>Chances of escape were the lad's chief thought, but the building
on which he stood went sheer down for a considerable way.&nbsp;
Then on the north side there came out the sharp, high-pitched,
tiled roof of the <i>corps du logis</i>; on the south, another
roof, surmounted by a cross at the gable, and evidently belonging
to the chapel; on the other two sides lay courts--that to the east,
a stable-yard; that to the west, a small narrow, chilly-looking,
paved inclosure, with enormously-massive walls, the doorway walled
up, and looking like a true prison-yard.&nbsp; Beyond this
wall--indeed, on every side-- extended offices, servants' houses,
stables, untidy desolate-looking gardens, and the whole was
inclosed by the white wall with flanking red-tiled turrets, whose
gaudy appearance had last night made Philip regard the whole as a
flimsy, Frenchchified erection, but he now saw it to be of
extremely solid stone and lime, and with no entrance but the great
barbican gateway they had entered by; moreover, with a yawning dry
moat all round.&nbsp; Wherever he looked he saw these tall, pointed
red caps, resembling, he thought, those worn by the victims of an
<i>auto-de-fe</i>, as one of Walsingham's secretaries had described
them to him; and he ground his teeth at them, as thought they
grinned at him like emissaries of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>Descending, he found Berenger dressing in haste to avoid
receiving an invalid visit from the Chevalier, looking indeed
greatly shaken, but hardly so as would have been detected by eyes
that had not seen him during his weeks of hope and recovery.&nbsp;
He was as resolved as Philip could wish against any sign of
weakness before his enemy, and altogether disclaimed illness,
refusing the stock of cooling drinks, cordials, and febrifuges,
which the Chevalier said had been sent by his sister the Abbess of
Bellaise.&nbsp; He put the subject of his health aside, only asking
if this were the day that the gendarme-captain would return to
Paris, and then begging to see that officer, so as to have a
distinct understanding of the grounds of his imprisonment.&nbsp;
The captain had, however, been a mere instrument; and when Philip
clamoured to be taken before the next justice of the peace, even
Berenger smiled at him for thinking that such a being existed in
France.&nbsp; The only cause alleged was the vague but dangerous
suspicion of conveying correspondence between England and the
heretics, and this might become extremely perilous to one
undeniably half English, regarded as whole Huguenot, caught on the
way to La Rochelle with a letter to La Noue in his pocket; and,
moreover, to one who had had a personal affray with a king famous
for storing up petty offences, whom the last poor king had
favoured, and who, in fine, had claims to estates that could not
spared to the Huguenot interest.</p>

<p>He was really not sure that there was not some truth in the
professions of the Chevalier being anxious to protect him from the
Queen-mother and the Guises; he had never been able to divest
himself of a certain trust in his old kinsman's friendliness, and
he was obliged to be beholden to him for the forms in which to
couch his defence.&nbsp; At the same time he wrote to Sir Francis
Walsingham, and to his grandfather, but with great caution, lest
his letters should be inspected by his enemies, and with the less
hope of their availing him because it was probable that the
Ambassador would return home on the king's death.&nbsp; No answer
could be expected for at least a fortnight, and even then it was
possible that the Queen-mother might choose to refer the cause to
King Henry, who was then in Poland.</p>

<p>Berenger wrote these letters with much thought and care, but
when they were once sealed, he collapsed again into despair and
impatience, and frantically paced the little court as if he would
dash himself against the walls that detained him from Eustacie;
then threw himself moodily into a chair, hid his face in his
crossed arms, and fell a prey to all the wretched visions called up
by an excited brain.</p>

<p>However, he was equally alive with Philip to the high-spirited
resolution that his enemies should not perceive or triumph in his
dejection.&nbsp; He showed himself at the noon-day dinner, before
Captain Delarue departed, grave and silent, but betraying no
agitation; and he roused himself from his sad musings at the
supper-hour, to arrange his hair, and assume the ordinary dress of
gentlemen in the evening; though Philip laughed at the roses
adorning his shoes, and his fresh ruff, as needless attentions to
an old ruffian like the Chevalier.&nbsp; However, Philip started
when he entered the hall, and beheld, not the Chevalier alone, but
with him the beautiful lady of the velvet coach, and another
stately, extremely handsome dame, no longer in her first youth, and
in costly black and white garments.&nbsp; When the Chevalier called
her his sister, Madame de Bellaise, Philip had no notion that she
was anything but a widow, living a secular life; and though a
couple of nuns attended her, their dress was so much less
conventual than Cecily's that he did not at first find them
out.&nbsp; It was explained that Madame de Selinville was residing
with her aunt, and that, having come to visit her father, he had
detained the ladies to supper, hoping to enliven the sojourn of his
<i>beaux cousins</i>.</p>

<p>Madame de Selinville, looking anxiously at Berenger, hoped she
saw him in better health.&nbsp; He replied, stiffly, that he was
perfectly well; and then, by way of safety, repaired to the society
of the Abbess, who immediately began plying him with questions
about England, its court, and especially the secret marriage of
Queen Elisabeth and '<i>ce</i> Comte de Dudley,' on which she was
so minutely informed as to put him to the blush.&nbsp; Then she was
very curious about the dispersed convents, and how many of the nuns
had married; and she seemed altogether delighted to have secured
the attention of a youth from the outer world.&nbsp; His soul at
first recoiled from her as one of Eustacie's oppressors, and from
her unconvent-like talk; and yet he could not but think her a
good-natured person, and wonder if she could rally have been hard
upon his poor little wife.&nbsp; And she, who had told Eustacie she
would strangle with her own hands the scion of the rival
house!--she, like most women, was much more bitter against an
unseen being out of reach, than towards a courteously-mannered,
pale, suffering-looking youth close beside her.&nbsp; She had
enough affection for Eustacie to have grieved much at her
wanderings and at her fate; and now the sorrow-stricken look that
by no effort could be concealed really moved her towards the youth
bereaved husband. Besides, were not all feuds on the point of being
made up by the excellent device concocted between her brother and
her niece?</p>

<p>Meantime, Philip was in raptures with the kindness of the
beautiful Madame de Selinville.&nbsp; He, whom the Mistresses
Walsingham treated as a mere clumsy boy, was promoted by her manner
to be a man and a cavalier.&nbsp; He blushed up to the roots of his
hair and looked sheepish whenever one of her entrancing smiles lit
upon him; but then she inquired after his brother so cordially, she
told him so openly how brilliant had been Berenger's career at the
court, she regretted so heartily their present danger and
detention, and promised so warmly to use her interest with Queen
Catherine, that in the delight of being so talked to, he forgot his
awkwardness and spoke freely and confidentially, maybe too
confidentially, for he caught Berenger frowning at him, and made a
sudden halt in his narrative, disconcerted but very angry with his
brother for his distrust.</p>

<p>When the ladies had ridden away to the convent in the summer
evening, and the two brothers had returned to their prison, Philip
would have begun to rave about Madame de Selinville, but his mouth
was stopped at once with 'Don't be such a fool, Phil!' and when
Perrine shut his eyes, leant back, and folded his arms together,
there was no more use in talking to him.</p>

<p>This exceeding defection continued for a day or two, while
Berenger's whole spirit chafed in agony at his helplessness, and
like demons there ever haunted him the thoughts of what might
betide Eustacie, young, fair, forsaken, and believing herself a
widow.&nbsp; Proudly defiant as he showed himself to all eyes
beyond his tower, he seemed to be fast gnawing and pining himself
away in the anguish he suffered through these long days of
captivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was Philip's excitement about any chance of meeting
Madame de Selinville that first roused him from the contemplation
of his own misery.&nbsp; It struck him that if he did not rouse
himself to exert his influence, the boy, left to no companionship
save what he could make for himself, might be led away by
intercourse with the gendarmes, or by the blandishments of Diane,
whatever might be her game.&nbsp; He must be watched over, and
returned to Sir Marmaduke the same true-hearted honest lad who had
left home.&nbsp; Nor had Berenger lain so long under Cecily St.
John's tender watching without bearing away some notes of patience,
trust, and dutifulness that returned upon him as his mind recovered
tone after the first shock.&nbsp; The whispers that had bidden him
tarry the Lord's leisure, be strong, and commit his way to Him who
could bring it to pass, and could save Eustacie as she had already
been saved, returned to him once more: he chid himself for his
faintness of heart, rallied his powers, and determined that
cheerfulness, dutifulness, and care for Philip should no longer
fail.</p>

<p>So he reviewed his resources, and in the first place arranged
for a brief daily worship with his two English fellow-prisoners,
corresponding to the home hours of chapel service.&nbsp; Then he
proposed to Philip to spend an hour every day over the study of the
Latin Bible; and when Philip showed himself reluctant to give up
his habit of staring over the battlements, he represented that an
attack on their faith was not so improbable but that they ought to
be prepared for it.</p>

<p>'I'm quite prepared,' quoth Philip; 'I shall not listen to a
word they say.'</p>

<p>However, he submitted to this, but was more contumacious as to
Berenger's other proposal of profiting by Sidney's copy of
Virgil.&nbsp; Here at least he was away from Mr. Adderley and
study, and it passed endurance to have Latin and captivity both at
once.&nbsp; He was more obliged for Berenger's offer to impart to
him the instruction in fencing he had received during his first
visit to Paris; the Chevalier made no difficulty about lending them
foils, and their little court became the scene of numerous
encounters, as well as of other games and exercises.&nbsp; More
sedentary sports were at their service, chess, tables, dice, or
cards, but Philip detested these, and they were only played in the
evening, or on a rainy afternoon, by Berenger and the
Chevalier.</p>

<p>It was clearly no part of the old gentleman's plan to break
their health or spirits.&nbsp; He insisted on taking them out
riding frequently, though always with four gendarmes with loaded
arquebuses, so as to preclude all attempt at escape, or
conversation with the peasants. The rides were hateful to both
youths, but Berenger knew that so many hours of tedium were thus
disposed of, and hoped also to acquire some knowledge of the
country; indeed, he looked at every cottage and every peasant with
affectionate eyes, as probably having sheltered Eustacie; and
Philip, after one visit paid to the convent at Bellaise, was always
in hopes of making such another.&nbsp; His boyish admiration of
Madame de Selinville was his chief distraction, coming on in
accesses whenever there was a hope of seeing her, and often
diverting Berenger by its absurdities, even though at other times
he feared that the lad might be led away by it, or dissension sown
between them.&nbsp; Meetings were rare--now and then Madame de
Selinville would appear at dinner or at supper as her father's
guest; and more rarely, the Chevalier would turn his horse's head
in the direction of Bellaise, and the three gentlemen would be
received in the unpartitioned parlour, and there treated to such
lemon cakes as had been the ruin of La Sablerie; but in general the
castle and the convent had little intercourse, or only just enough
to whet the appetite of the prisoners for what constituted their
only variety.</p>

<p>Six weeks had lagged by before any answer from Paris was
received, and then there was no reply from Walsingham, who had, it
appeared, returned home immediately after King Charles's
funeral.&nbsp; The letter from the Council bore that the
Queen-mother was ready to accept the Baron de Ribaumont's excuses
in good part, and to consider his youth; and she had no doubt of
his being treated with the like indulgence by the King, provided he
would prove himself a loyal subject, by embracing the Catholic
faith, renouncing all his illegitimate claims to the estates of Nid
de Merle, and, in pledge of his sincerity, wedding his cousin, the
Countess de Selinville, so soon as a dispensation should have been
procured.&nbsp; On no other consideration could he be pardoned or
set at liberty.</p>

<p>'Then,' said Berenger, slowly, 'a prisoner I must remain until
it be the will of Heaven to open the doors.'</p>

<p>'Fair nephew!' exclaimed the Chevalier, 'make no rash
replies.&nbsp; Bethink you to what you expose yourself by
obstinacy; I may no longer be able to protect you when the King
returns.&nbsp; And he further went on to represent that, by
renouncing voluntarily all possible claims on the Nid de Merle
estates, the Baron would save the honour of poor Eustacie (which
indeed equally concerned the rest of the family), since they then
would gladly drop all dispute of the validity of the marriage; and
the lands of Selinville would be an ample equivalent for these, as
well as for all expectations in England.</p>

<p>'Sir, it is impossible!' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'My wife
lives.'</p>

<p><i>'Comment!</i> when you wear mourning for her.'</p>

<p>'I wear black because I have been able to procure nothing else
since I have been convinced that she did not perish at La
Sablerie.&nbsp; I was on my way to seek her when I was seized and
detained here.'</p>

<p>'Where would you have sought her, my poor cousin?'
compassionately asked the Chevalier.</p>

<p>'That I know not.&nbsp; She may be in England by this time; but
that she escaped from La Sablerie, I am well assured.'</p>

<p>'Alas! my poor friend, you feed on delusion.&nbsp; I have surer
evidence--you shall see the man yourself--one of my son's people,
who was actually at the assault, and had strict orders to seek and
save her.&nbsp; Would that I could feel the least hope left!'</p>

<p>'Is the man here?&nbsp; Let me see him,' said Berenger,
hastily.</p>

<p>He was at once sent for, and proved to be one of the stable
servants, a rough, soldierly-looking man, who made no difficulty in
telling that M. de Nid de Merle had bidden his own troop to use
every effort to reach the Widow Laurent's house, and secure the
lady.&nbsp; They had made for it, but missed the way, and met with
various obstacles; and when they reached it, it was already in
flames, and he had seen for a moment Mademoiselle de Nid de Merle,
whom he well knew by sight, with an infant in her arms at an upper
window.&nbsp; He had called to her by name, and was about to send
for a ladder, when recognizing the Ribaumont colours, she had
turned back, and thrown herself and her child into the
flames.&nbsp; M. de Nid de Merle was frantic when he heard of it,
and they had searched for the remains among the ruins; but, bah! it
was like a lime-kiln, nothing was to be found--all was
calcined.</p>

<p>'No fragment left?' said Berenger; 'not a corner of tile or
beam?'</p>

<p>'Not so much wood as you could boil an egg with; I will swear it
on the Mass.'</p>

<p>'That is needless,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'I have seen the spot
myself.&nbsp; That is all I desired to ask.'</p>

<p>The Chevalier would have taken his hand and condoled with him
over the horrible story; but he drew back, repeating that he had
seen Widow Laurent's house, and that he saw that some parts of the
man's story were so much falsified that he could not believe the
rest.&nbsp; Moreover, he knew that Eustacie had not been in the
town at the time of the siege.</p>

<p>Now the Chevalier <i>bona fide</i> believed the man's story, so
far as that he never doubted that Eustacie had perished, and he
looked on Berenger's refusal to accept the tale as the mournful
last clinging to a vain hope.&nbsp; In his eyes, the actual sight
of Eustacie, and the total destruction of the house, were mere
matters of embellishment, possibly untrue, but not invalidating the
main fact.&nbsp; He only said, 'Well, my friend, I will not press
you while the pain of this narration is still fresh.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, sir; but this is not pain, for I believe not a word
of it; therefore it is impossible for me to entertain the proposal,
even if I could forsake my faith or my English kindred.&nbsp; You
remember, sir, that I returned this same answer at Paris, when I
had no hope that my wife survived.'</p>

<p>'True, my fair cousin, but I fear time will convince you that
this constancy is unhappily misplaced.&nbsp; You shall have time to
consider; and when it is proved to you that my poor niece is out of
the reach of your fidelity, and when you have become better
acquainted with the claims of the Church to your allegiance, then
may it only prove that your conversion does not come too
late.&nbsp; I have the honour to take my leave.'</p>

<p>'One moment more, sir.&nbsp; Is there no answer as to my
brother?'</p>

<p>'None, cousin.&nbsp; As I told you, your country has at present
no Ambassador; but, of course, on your fulfilment of the
conditions, he would be released with you.'</p>

<p>'So,' said Philip, when the old knight had quitted the room, 'of
course you cannot marry while Eustacie lives; but if---'</p>

<p>'Not another word, profane boy!' angrily cried Berenger.</p>

<p>'I was only going to say, it is a pity of one so goodly not to
bring her over to the true faith, and take her to England.'</p>

<p>'Much would she be beholden to you!' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'So!'
he added, sighing, 'I had little hope but that it would be
thus.&nbsp; I believe it is all a web of this old plotter's
weaving, and that the Queen-mother acts in it at his request.&nbsp;
He wants only to buy me off with his daughter's estates from
asserting my claim to this castle and lands; and I trow he will
never rise up here till--till---'</p>

<p>'Till when, Berry?'</p>

<p>'Till mayhap my grandfather can move the Queen to do something
for us; or till Madame de Selinville sees a face she likes better
than her brother's carving; or, what can I tell? till malice is
tired out, and Heaven's will sets us free.&nbsp; May Eustacie only
have reached home!&nbsp; But I'm sorry for you, my poor Phil.'</p>

<p>'Never heed, brother,' said Philip; 'what is prison to me, so
that I can now and then see those lovely eyes?'</p>

<p>And the languishing air of the clumsy lad was so comical as to
beguile Berenger into a laugh.&nbsp; Yet Berenger's own feeling
would go back to his first meeting with Diane; and as he thought of
the eyes then fixed on him, he felt that he was under a trial that
might become more severe.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.&nbsp; THE DARK POOL OF THE FUTURE</h3>

<p>Triumph, triumph, only she</p>

<p>That knit his bonds can set him free.--SOUTHEY</p>

<p>No change was made in the life of the captives of Nid de Merle
after the answer from Paris, except that Pere Bonami, who had
already once or twice dined at the Chevalier's table, was requested
to make formal exposition of the errors of the Reformers and of the
tenets of his own Church to the Baron de Ribaumont.</p>

<p>Philip took such good care not to be deluded that, though he sat
by to see fair play, yet it was always with his elbows on the table
and his fingers in his ears, regardless of appearing to the priest
in the character of the deaf adder.&nbsp; After all, he was not the
object, and good Pere Bonami at first thought the day his own, when
he found that almost all his arguments against Calvinism were
equally impressed upon Berenger's mind, but the differences soon
revealed themselves; and the priest, though a good man, was not a
very happily-chosen champion, for he was one of the old-fashioned,
scantily-instructed country priests, who were more numerous before
the Jesuit revival of learning, and knew nothing of controversy
save that adapted to the doctrines of Calvin; so that in dealing
with an Anglican of the school of Ridley and Hooker, it was like
bow ad arrow against sword.&nbsp; And tin those days of change,
controversial reading was one of the primary studies even of young
laymen, and Lord Walwyn, with a view to his grandson's peculiar
position, had taken care that he should be well instructed, so that
he was not at all unequal to the contest.&nbsp; Moreover, apart
from argument, he clung as a point of honour to the Church as to
the wife that he had accepted in his childhood; and often tried to
recall the sketch that Philip Sidney had once given him of a tale
that a friend of his designed to turn into a poem, like Ariosto's,
in <i>terza rima</i>, of a Red Cross knight separated from his Una
as the true faith, and tempted by a treacherous Duessa, who
impersonated at once Falsehood and Rome.&nbsp; And he knew so well
that the last relaxation of his almost terrified resistance would
make him so entirely succumb to Diane's beauty and brilliancy, that
he kept himself stiffly frigid and reserved.</p>

<p>Diane never openly alluded to the terms on which he stood, but
he often found gifts from unknown hands placed in his room.&nbsp;
The books which he had found there were changed when he had had
time to study them; and marks were placed in some of the most
striking passages.&nbsp; They were of the class that turned the
brain of the Knight of La Mancha, but with a predominance of the
pastoral, such as Diane of George of Montemayor and his numerous
imitators--which Philip thought horrible stuff--enduring nothing
but a few of the combats of Amadis de Gaul or Palmerin of England,
until he found that Madame de Selinville prodigiously admired the
'silly swains more silly than their sheep,' and was very anxious
that M. le Baron should be touched by their beauties; whereupon
honest Philip made desperate efforts to swallow them in his
brother's stead, but was always found fast asleep in the very
middle of arguments between Damon and Thyrsis upon the <i>
devoirs</i> of love, or the mournings of some disconsolate nymph
over her jealousies of a favoured rival.</p>

<p>One day, a beautiful ivory box, exhaling sweet perfume, appeared
in the prison chamber, and therewith a sealed letter in verse,
containing an affecting description of how Corydon had been cruelly
torn by the lions in endeavouring to bear away Sylvie from her
cavern, how Sylvie had been rent from him and lost, and how vainly
he continued to bewail her, and disregard the loving lament of
Daphne, who had ever mourned and pined for him as she kept her
flock, made the rivulets, the brooks, the mountains re-echo with
her sighs and plaints, and had wandered through the hills and
valleys, gathering simples wherewith she had compounded a balsam
that might do away with the scars that the claws of the lions had
left, so that he might again appear with the glowing cheeks and
radiant locks that had excited the envy of the god of day.</p>

<p>Berenger burst out laughing over the practical part of this
poetical performance, and laughed the more at Philip's hurt,
injured air at his mirth.&nbsp; Philip, who would have been the
first to see the absurdity in any other Daphne, thought this a
passing pleasant device, and considered it very unkind in his
brother not even to make experiment of the balsam of simples, but
to declare that he had much rather keep his scars for Eustacie's
sake than wear a smooth face to please Diane.</p>

<p>Still Berenger's natural courtesy stood in his way.&nbsp; He
could not help being respectful and attentive to the old Chevalier,
when their terms were, apparently at least, those of host and
guest; and to a lady he COULD not be rude and repellent, though he
could be reserved.&nbsp; So, when the kinsfolk met, no stranger
would have discovered that one was a prisoner and the others his
captors.</p>

<p>One August day, when Madame de Selinville and her lady
attendants were supping at the castle at the early hour of six, a
servant brought in word that an Italian pedlar craved leave to
display his wares.&nbsp; He was welcome, both for need's sake and
for amusement, and was readily admitted.&nbsp; He was a handsome
olive-faced Italian, and was followed by a little boy with a skin
of almost Moorish dye--and great was the display at once made on
the tables, of</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Lawn as white as driven snow,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyprus, black as e'er was crow;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloves as sweet as fragrant posies,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masks for faces and for noses;'</p>

<p>and there was a good deal of the eager, desultory bargaining
that naturally took place where purchasing was an unusual
excitement and novelty, and was to form a whole evening's
amusement.&nbsp; Berenger, while supplying the defects of his
scanty travelling wardrobe, was trying to make out whether he had
seen the man before, wondering if he were the same whom he had met
in the forest of Montipipeau, though a few differences in dress,
hair, and beard made him somewhat doubtful.</p>

<p>'Perfumes?&nbsp; Yes, lady, I have store of perfumes: ambergris
and violet dew, and the Turkish essence distilled from roses; yea,
and the finest spirit of the Venus myrtle-tree, the secret known to
the Roman dames of old, whereby they secured perpetual beauty and
love --though truly Madame should need no such essence.&nbsp; That
which nature has bestowed on her secures to her all hearts--and one
valued more than all.'</p>

<p>'Enough,' said Diane, blushing somewhat, though with an effort
at laughing off his words; 'these are the tricks of your
trade.'</p>

<p>'Madame is incredulous; yet, lady, I have been in the
East.&nbsp; Yonder boy comes from the land where there are spells
that make known the secrets of lives.'</p>

<p>The old Chevalier, who had hitherto been taken up with the
abstruse calculation--derived from his past days of economy--how
much ribbon would be needed to retrim his murrey <i>
just-au-corps</i>, here began to lend an ear, though saying
nothing. Philip looked on in open-eyed wonder, and nudged his
brother, who muttered in return, 'Jugglery!'</p>

<p>'Ah, the fair company are all slow to believe,' said the
pedlar.&nbsp; 'Hola, Alessio!' and taking a glove that Philip had
left on the table, he held it to the boy.&nbsp; A few
unintelligible words passed between them; then the boy pointed
direct to Philip, and waved his hand northwards.&nbsp; 'He says the
gentleman who owns this glove comes from the North, from far away,'
interpreted the Italian; then as the boy made the gesture of
walking in chains, 'that he is a captive.'</p>

<p>'Ay,' cried Philip, 'right, lad; and can he tell how long I
shall be so?'</p>

<p>'Things yet to come,' said the mountebank, 'are only revealed
after long preparation.&nbsp; For them must he gaze into the dark
poor of the future.&nbsp; The present and the past he can divine by
the mere touch of what has belonged to the person.'</p>

<p>'It is passing strange,' said Philip to Madame de
Selinville.&nbsp; 'You credit it, Madame?'</p>

<p>'Ah, have we not seen the wonders come to pass that a like
diviner fortold to the Queen-mother?' said Diane: 'her sons should
be all kings--that was told her when the eldest was yet
Dauphin.'</p>

<p>'And there is only one yet to come,' said Philip,
awe-struck.&nbsp; 'But see, what has he now?'</p>

<p>'Veronique's kerchief,' returned Madame de Selinville, as the
Italian began to interpret the boy's gesture.</p>

<p>'Pretty maidens, he says, serve fair ladies--bear tokens for
them.&nbsp; This damsel has once been the bearer of a bouquet of
heather of the pink and white, whose bells were to ring hope.'</p>

<p>'Eh, eh, Madame, it is true?' cried Veronique, crimson with
surprise and alarm.&nbsp; 'M. le Baron knows it is true.'</p>

<p>Berenger had started at this revelation, and uttered an
inarticulate exclamation; but at that moment the boy, in whose hand
his master had placed a crown from the money newly paid, began to
make vehement gestures, which the main interpreted.&nbsp; <i>'Le
Balafre</i>, he says, pardon me, gentlemen, <i>le Balafre</i> could
reveal even a deeper scar of the heart than of the visage'--and the
boy's brown hand was pressed on his heart--'yet truly there is yet
hope <i>(esperance</i>) to be found.&nbsp; Yes'--as the boy put his
hand to his neck--'he bears a pearl, parted from its sister
pearls.&nbsp; Where they are, there is hope.&nbsp; Who can miss
Hope, who has sought it at a royal death-bed?'</p>

<p>'Ah, where is it?' Berenger could not help exclaiming.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said the pedlar, 'as I told Messieurs and Mesdames
before, the spirits that cast the lights of the future on the dark
pool need invocation.&nbsp; Ere he can answer M. le Baron's
demands, he and I must have time and seclusion.&nbsp; If Monsieur
le Chevalier will grant us an empty room, there will we answer all
queries on which the spirits will throw light.'</p>

<p>'And how am I to know that you will not bring the devil to
shatter the castle, my friend?' demanded the Chevalier.&nbsp; 'Or
more likely still, that you are not laughing all the time at these
credulous boys and ladies?'</p>

<p>'Of that, sir, you may here convince yourself,' said the
mountebank, putting into his hand a sort of credential in Italian,
signed by Renato di Milano, the Queen's perfumer, testifying to the
skill of his compatriot Ercole Stizzito both in perfumery,
cosmetics, and in the secrets of occult sciences.</p>

<p>The Chevalier was no Italian scholar, and his daughter
interpreted the scroll to him, in a rapid low voice, adding, 'I
have had many dealings with Rene of Milan, father.&nbsp; I know he
speaks sooth.&nbsp; There can be no harm in letting the poor man
play out his play--all the castle servants will be frantic to have
their fortunes told.'</p>

<p>'I must speak with the fellow first, daughter,' said the
Chevalier.&nbsp; 'He must satisfy me that he has no unlawful
dealings that could bring the Church down on us.'&nbsp; And he
looked meaningly at the mountebank, who replied by a whole
muster-roll of ecclesiastics, male and female, who had heard and
approved his predictions.</p>

<p>'A few more words with thee, fellow,' said the Chevalier,
pointing the way to one of the rooms opening out of the hall.&nbsp;
'As master of the house I must be convinced of his honesty,' he
added.&nbsp; 'If I am satisfied, then who will may seek to hear
their fortune.'</p>

<p>Chevalier, man and boy disappeared, and Philip was the first to
exclaim, 'A strange fellow!&nbsp; What will he tell us?&nbsp;
Madame, shall you hear him?'</p>

<p>'That depends on my father's report,' she said.&nbsp; 'And yet,'
sadly and pensively, 'my future is dark and void enough.&nbsp; Why
should I vex myself with hearing it?'</p>

<p>'Nay, it may brighten,' said Philip.</p>

<p>'Scarcely, while hearts are hard,' she murmured with a slight
shake of the head, that Philip thought indescribably touching; but
Berenger was gathering his purchases together, and did not
see.&nbsp; 'And you, brother,' said Philip, 'you mean to prove
him?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'Have you forgotten, Phil, the anger
we met with, when we dealt with the gipsy at Hurst Fair?'</p>

<p>'Pshaw, Berry, we are past flogging now.'</p>

<p>'Out of reach, Phil, of the rod, but scarce of the teaching it
struck into us.'</p>

<p>'What?' said Philip, sulkily.</p>

<p>'That divining is either cozening manor forsaking God,
Phil.&nbsp; Either it is falsehood, or it is a lying wonder of the
devil.'</p>

<p>'But, Berry, this man is not cheat.'</p>

<p>'Then he is worse.'</p>

<p>'Only, turn not away, brother.&nbsp; How should he have known
things that even I know not?--the heather.'</p>

<p>'No marvel in that,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'This is the very man
I bought Annora's fan from; he was prowling round Montpipeau, and
my heather was given to Veronique with little secrecy.&nbsp; And as
to the royal deathbed, it was Rene, his master, who met me
there.'</p>

<p>'Then you think it mere cozening?&nbsp; If so, we should find it
out.'</p>

<p>'I don't reckon myself keener than an accomplished Italian
mountebank,' said Berenger, dryly.</p>

<p>Further conference was cut short by the return of the Chevalier,
saying, in his paternal genial way, 'Well, children, I have
examined the fellow and his credentials, and for those who have
enough youth and hope to care to have the future made known to
them, bah! it is well.'</p>

<p>'Is it sorcery, sir?' asked Philip, anxiously.</p>

<p>The Chevalier shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; 'What know I?' he
said.&nbsp; 'For those who have a fine nose for brimstone there may
be, but he assures me it is but the white magic practiced in Egypt,
and the boy is Christian!'</p>

<p>'Did you try this secret, father?' inquired Madame de
Selinville.</p>

<p>'I, my daughter?&nbsp; An old man's fortune is in his
children.&nbsp; What have I to ask?'</p>

<p>'I--I scarcely like to be the first!' said the lady, eager but
hesitating.&nbsp; 'Veronique, you would have your fortune
told?'</p>

<p>'I will be the first,' said Philip, stepping forward
manfully.&nbsp; 'I will prove him for you, lady, and tell you
whether he be a cozener or not, or if his magic be fit for you to
deal with.'</p>

<p>And confident in the inherent intuition of a plain Englishman,
as well as satisfied to exercise his resolution for once in
opposition to Berenger's opinion, Master Thistlewood stepped
towards the closet where the Italian awaited his clients, and
Berenger knew that it would be worse than useless to endeavour to
withhold him.&nbsp; He only chafed at the smile which passed
between father and daughter at this doughty self-assertion.</p>

<p>There was a long silence.&nbsp; Berenger sat with his eyes fixed
on the window where the twilight horizon was still soft and bright
with the pearly gold of the late sunset, thinking with an intensity
of yearning what it would be could he truly become certain of
Eustacie's present doings; questioning whether he would try to
satisfy that longing by the doubtful auguries of the diviner, and
then recollecting how he had heard from wrecked sailors that to
seek to delude their thirst with sea-water did but aggravate their
misery.&nbsp; He knew that whatever he might hear would be unworthy
of confidence.&nbsp; Either it merely framed to soothe and please
him--or, were it a genuine oracle, he had no faith in the instinct
that was to perceive it, but what he HAD faith in was the Divine
protection over his lost ones.&nbsp; 'No,' he thought to himself,
'I will not by a presumptuous sin, in my own impatience, risk
incurring woes on them that deal with familiar spirits and wizards
that peep and mutter.&nbsp; If ever I am to hear of Eustacie again,
it shall be by God's will, not the devil's.'</p>

<p>Diane de Selinville had been watching his face all the time, and
now said, with that almost timid air of gaiety that she wore when
addressing him: 'You too, cousin, are awaiting Monsieur Philippe's
report to decide whether to look into the pool of mystery.'</p>

<p>'Not at all, Madame,' said Berenger, gravely.&nbsp; 'I do not
understand white magic.'</p>

<p>'Our good cousin has been too well bred among the Reformers to
condescend to our little wickednesses, daughter,' said the
Chevalier; and the sneer-much like that which would await a person
now who scrupled at joining in table-turning or any form of
spiritualism--purpled Berenger's scar, now his only manner of
blushing; but he instantly perceived that it was the Chevalier's
desire that he should consult the conjurer, and therefore became
the more resolved against running into a trap.</p>

<p>'I am sure,' said Madame de Selinville, earnestly, though with
an affectation of lightness, 'a little wickedness is fair when
there is a great deal at stake.&nbsp; For my part, I would not
hesitate long, to find out how soon the King will relent towards my
fair cousin here!'</p>

<p>'That, Madame,' said Berenger, with the same grave dryness, 'is
likely to be better known to other persons than this wandering
Greek boy.'</p>

<p>Here Philip's step was heard returning hastily.&nbsp; He was
pale, and looked a good deal excited, so that Madame de Selinville
uttered a little cry, and exclaimed, 'Ah! is it so dreadful
then?'</p>

<p>'No, no, Madame,' said Philip, turning round, with a fervour and
confidence he had never before shown.&nbsp; 'On my word, there is
nothing formidable.&nbsp; You see nothing--nothing but the Italia
and the boy.&nbsp; The boy gazes into a vessel of some black
liquid, and sees--sees there all you would have revealed.&nbsp;
Ah!'</p>

<p>'Then you believe?' asked Madame de Selinville.</p>

<p>'It cannot be false,' answered Philip; 'he told me
everything.&nbsp; Things he could not have known.&nbsp; My very
home, my father's house, passed in review before that strange
little blackamoor's eyes; where I--though I would have given worlds
to see it--beheld only the lamp mirrored in the dark pool.'</p>

<p>'How do you know it was your father's house?' said
Berenger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'I could not doubt.&nbsp; Just to test the fellow, I bade him
ask for my native place.&nbsp; The little boy gazed, smiled,
babbled his gibberish, pointed.&nbsp; The man said he spoke of a
fair mansion among green fields and hills, "a grand <i>cavalier
embonpoint</i>,"--those were his very words,--at the door, with a
tankard in one hand.&nbsp; Ah! my dear father, why could not I see
him too?&nbsp; But who could mistake him or the Manor?'</p>

<p>'And did he speak of future as well as past?' said Diane.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, yes,' said Philip, with more agitation.&nbsp; 'Lady,
that will you know for yourself.'</p>

<p>'It was not dreadful?' she said, rising.</p>

<p>'Oh no!' and Philip had become crimson, and hesitated; 'certes,
not dreadful.&nbsp; But---I must not say more.'</p>

<p>'Save good night,' said Berenger, rising; 'See, our gendarmes
are again looking as if we had long exceeded their patience.&nbsp;
It is an hour later than we are wont to retire.'</p>

<p>'If it be your desire to consult this mysterious fellow now you
have heard your brother's report, my dear Baron,' said the
Chevalier, 'the gendarmes may devour their impatience a little
longer.'</p>

<p>'Thanks, sir,' said Berenger; 'but I am not tempted,' and he
gave the usual signal to the gendarmes, who, during meals, used to
stand as sentries at the great door of the hall.</p>

<p>'It might settle your mind,' muttered Philip, hesitating.&nbsp;
'And yet--yet---'</p>

<p>But he used no persuasions, and permitted himself to be escorted
with his brother along the passages to their own chamber, where he
threw himself into a chair with a long sigh, and did not
speak.&nbsp; Berenger meantime opened the Bible, glanced over the
few verses he meant to read, found the place in the Prayer-book,
and was going to the stairs to call Humfrey, when Philip broke
forth: 'Wait, Berry; don't be in such haste.'</p>

<p>'What, you want time to lose the taste of your dealings with the
devil?' said Berenger, smiling.</p>

<p>'Pshaw! No devil in the matter,' testily said Philip.&nbsp; 'No,
I was only wishing you had not had a Puritan fit, and seen and
heard for yourself.&nbsp; Then I should not have had to tell you,'
and he sighed.</p>

<p>'I have no desire to be told,' said Berenger, who had become
more fixed in the conviction that it was an imposture.</p>

<p>'No desire!&nbsp; Ah! I have none when I knew what it was.&nbsp;
But you ought to know.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Berenger, 'you will burst anon if I open not my
ears.'</p>

<p>'Dear Berry, speak not thus.&nbsp; It will be the worse for you
when you do hear.&nbsp; Alack, Berenger, all ours have been vain
hopes.&nbsp; I asked for HER--and the boy fell well-nigh into
convulsions of terror as he gazed; spoke of flames and falling
houses.&nbsp; That was wherefore I pressed you not again--it would
have wrung your heart too much.&nbsp; The boy fairly wept and
writhed himself, crying out in his tongue for pity on the fair lady
and the little babe in the burning house.&nbsp; Alack! brother,'
said Philip, a little hurt that his brother had not changed
countenance.</p>

<p>'This is the lying tale of the man-at-arms which our own eyes
contradicted,' said Berenger; 'and no doubt was likewise inspired
by the Chevalier.'</p>

<p>'See the boy, brother!&nbsp; How should he have heard the
Chevalier?&nbsp; Nay, you might hug your own belief, but it is hard
that we should both be in durance for your mere dream that she
lives.'</p>

<p>'Come, Phil, it will be the devil indeed that sows dissension
between us,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'You know well enough that were
it indeed with my poor Eustacie as they would fain have us believe,
rather than give up her fair name I would not in prison for
life.&nbsp; Or would you have me renounce my faith, or wed Madame
de Selinville upon the witness of a pool of ink that I am a
widower?' he added, almost laughing.</p>

<p>'For that matter,' muttered Philip, a good deal ashamed and half
affronted, 'you know I value the Protestant faith so that I never
heard a word from the will old priest.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the boy,
when I asked of our release, saw the gates set open by Love.'</p>

<p>'What did Love look like in the pool?&nbsp; Had he wings like
the Cupids in the ballets at the Louvre?' asked Berenger
provokingly.</p>

<p>'I tell you I saw nothing,' said Philip, tartly: 'this was the
Italian's interpretation of the boy's gesture.&nbsp; It was to be
by means of love, he said, and of a lady who---he made it plain
enough who she was,' added the boy, colouring.</p>

<p>'No doubt, as the Chevalier have instructed him to say that
I--I--' he hesitated, 'that my--my love--I mean that he saw my
shield per pale with the field fretty and the sable leopard.'</p>

<p>'Oh! it is to be my daughter, is it?' said Berenger, laughing;
'I am very happy to entertain your proposals for her.'</p>

<p>'Berenger, what mocking fiend has possessed you?' cried Philip,
half angrily, half pitifully.&nbsp; 'How can you so speak of that
poor child?'</p>

<p>'Because the more they try to force on me the story of her fate,
the plainer it is to me that they do not believe it.&nbsp; I shall
find her yet, and then, Phil, you shall have the first chance.'</p>

<p>Philip growled.</p>

<p>'Well, Phil,' said his brother, good-humouredly, 'any way, till
this Love comes that is to let us out, don't let Moor or fiend come
between us.&nbsp; Let me keep my credence for the honest Bailli's
daughters at Lucon; and remember I would give my life to free you,
but I cannot give away my faith.'&nbsp; Philip bent his head.&nbsp;
He was of too stubborn a mould to express contrition or affection,
but he mused for five minutes, then called Humfrey, and at the last
moment, as the heavy tread came up-stairs, he turned round and
said, 'You're in the right on't there, Berry.&nbsp; Hap what hap,
the foul fiend may carry off the conjurer before I murmur at you
again!&nbsp; Still I wish you had seen him.&nbsp; You would know
'tis sooth.'</p>

<p>While Berenger, in his prison chamber, with the lamplight
beaming on his high white brow and clear eye, stood before his two
comrades in captivity, their true-hearted faces composed to
reverence, and as he read, 'I have hated them that hold of
superstitious vanities, and my trust hath been in the Lord.&nbsp; I
will be glad and rejoice in Thy mercy, for Thou hast considered my
trouble and hast known my soul in adversities,' feeling that here
was the oracle by which he was willing to abide--Diane de
Selinville was entering the cabinet where the secrets of the future
were to be unveiled.</p>

<p>There she stood--the beautiful court lady--her lace coif (of the
Mary of Scotland type) well framed the beautiful oval of her face,
and set of the clear olive of her complexion, softened by short
jetty curls at the temples, and lighted splendid dark eyes, and by
the smiles of a perfect pair of lips.&nbsp; A transparent veil hung
back over the ruff like frostwork-formed fairy wings, and over the
white silk bodice and sleeves laced with violet, and the violet
skirt that fell in ample folds on the ground; only, however, in the
dim light revealing by an occasional gleam that it was not
black.&nbsp; It was a stately presence, yet withal there was a
tremor, a quiver of the downcast eyelids, and a trembling of the
fair hand, as though she were ill at ease; even though it was by no
means the first time she had trafficked with the dealers in
mysterious arts who swarmed around Catherine de Medicis.&nbsp;
There were words lately uttered that weighed with her in their
simplicity, and she could not forget them in that gloomy light, as
she gazed on the brown face of the Italian, Ercole, faultless in
outline as a classical mask, but the black depths of the eyes
sparkling with intensity of observation, as if they were everywhere
at once and gazed through and through.&nbsp; He wore his national
dress, with the short cloak over one shoulder; but the little boy,
who stood at the table, had been fantastically arrayed in a sort of
semi-Albanian garb, a red cap with a long tassel, a dark,
gold-embroidered velvet jacket sitting close to his body, and a
white kilt over his legs, bare except for buskins stiff with
gold.&nbsp; The poor little fellow looked pale in spite of his
tawny hue, his enormous black eyes were heavy and weary, and he
seemed to be trying to keep aloof from the small brazen vessel
formed by the coils of two serpents that held the inky liquid of
which Philip had spoken.</p>

<p>No doubt of the veritable nature of the charm crossed Diane; her
doubt was of its lawfulness, her dread of the supernatural region
she was invading.&nbsp; She hesitated before she ventured on her
first question, and started as the Italian first spoke,--'What
would the Eccelentissima?&nbsp; Ladies often hesitate to speak the
question nearest their hearts.&nbsp; Yet is it ever the same. But
the lady must be pleased to form it herself in words, or the lad
will not see her vision.'</p>

<p>'Where, then, is my brother?' said Diane, still reluctant to
come direct to the point.</p>

<p>The boy gazed intently into the black pool, his great eyes
dilating till they seemed like black wells, and after a long time,
that Diane could have counted by the throbs of her heart, he began
to close his fingers, perform the action over the other arm of one
playing on the lute, throw his head back, close his eyes, and
appear to be singing a lullaby.&nbsp; Then he spoke a few words to
his master quickly.</p>

<p>'He see,' said Ercole, 'a gentleman touching the lute, seated in
a bedroom, where lies, on a rich pillow, another gentleman,'--and
as the boy stroked his face, and pointed to his hands--'wearing a
mask and gloves.&nbsp; It is, he says, in my own land, in Italy,'
and as the boy made the action of rowing, 'in the territory of
Venice.'</p>

<p>'It is well,' said Madame de Selinville, who knew that nothing
was more probable than that her brother should be playing the King
to his sleep in the medicated mask and gloves that cherished the
royal complexion, and, moreover, that Henry was lingering to take
his pastime in Italy to the great inconvenience of his kingdom.</p>

<p>Her next question came nearer her heat--'You saw the gentleman
with a scar.&nbsp; Will he leave this castle?'</p>

<p>The boy gazed, then made gestures of throwing his arms wide, and
of passing out; and as he added his few words, the master
explained:</p>

<p>'He sees the gentleman leaving the castle, through open gate, in
full day, on horseback; and--and it is Madame who is with them,' he
added, as the lad pointed decidedly to her, 'it is Madame who opens
their prison.'</p>

<p>Diane's face lighted with gladness for a moment; then she said,
faltering (most women of her day would not have been even thus
reserved), 'Then I shall marry again?'</p>

<p>The boy gazed and knitted his brow; then, without any pantomime,
looked up and spoke.&nbsp; 'The Eccellentissima shall be a bride
once more, he says,' explained the man, 'but after a sort he cannot
understand.&nbsp; It is exhausting, lady, thus to gaze into the
invisible future; the boy becomes confused and exhausted ere
long.'</p>

<p>'Once more--I will only ask of the past.&nbsp; My cousin, is he
married or a widower?'</p>

<p>The boy clasped his hands and looked imploringly, shaking his
head at the dark pool, as he murmured an entreating word to his
master.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Ah! Madame,' said the Italian, 'that question hath already been
demanded by the young Inglese.&nbsp; The poor child has been so
terrified by the scene it called up, that he implored he may not
see it again.&nbsp; A sacked and burning town, a lady in a flaming
house---'</p>

<p>'Enough, enough,' said de; 'I could as little bear to hear as he
to see.&nbsp; It is what we have ever known and feared.&nbsp; And
now'--she blushed as she spoke--'sir, you will leave me one of
those potions that Signor Renato is wont to compound.'</p>

<p>'<i>Capisco</i>!' said Ercole; 'but the Eccellentissima shall he
obeyed if she will supply the means, for the expense will be
heavy.'</p>

<p>The bargain was agreed upon, and a considerable sum advanced for
a philtre, compounded of strange Eastern plants and mystic jewels;
and then Diane, with a shudder of relief, passed into the full
light of the hall, bade her father good night, and was handed by
him into the litter that had long been awaiting her at the
door.</p>

<p>The Chevalier, then, with care on his brow, bent his steps
towards the apartment where the Italian still remained counting the
money he had received.</p>

<p>'So!' he said as he entered, 'so, fellow, I have not hindered
your gains, and you have been true to your agreement?'</p>

<p>'Illustrissimo, yes.&nbsp; The pool of vision mirrored the
flames, but nothing beyond--nothing--nothing.'</p>

<p>'They asked you then no more of those words you threw out of
Esperance?'</p>

<p>'Only the English youth, sir; and there were plenty of other
hopes to dance before the eyes of such a lad!&nbsp; With M. le
Baron it will be needful to be more guarded.'</p>

<p>'M. le Baron shall not have the opportunity,' said the
Chevalier.&nbsp; 'He may abide by his decision, and what the
younger one may tell him.&nbsp; Fear not, good man, it shall be
made good to you, if you obey my commands.&nbsp; I have other work
for you.&nbsp; But first repeat to me more fully what you told me
before.&nbsp; Where was it that you saw this unhappy girl under the
name of Esperance?'</p>

<p>'At a hostel, sir, at Charente, where she was attending on an
old heretic teacher of the name of Gardon, who had fallen sick
there, being pinched by the fiend with rheumatic pains after his
deserts.&nbsp; She bore the name of Esperance Gardon, and passed
for his son's widow.'</p>

<p>'And by what means did you know her not to be the mean creature
she pretended?' said the Chevalier, with a gesture of scornful
horror.</p>

<p>'Illustrissimo, I never forget a face.&nbsp; I had seen this
lady with M. le Baron when they made purchases of various trinkets
at Montpipeau; and I saw her full again.&nbsp; I had the honour to
purchase from her certain jewels, that the Eccellenza will probably
redeem; and even--pardon, sir--I cut off and bought of her, her
hair.'</p>

<p>'Her hair!' exclaimed the Chevalier, in horror.&nbsp; 'The
miserable girl to have fallen so low!&nbsp; Is it with you,
fellow?'</p>

<p>'Surely, Illustrissimo.&nbsp; Such tresses--so shining, so
silky, so well kept,--I reserved to adorn the heads of Signor
Renato's most princely customers', said the man, unpacking from the
inmost recesses of one of his most ingeniously arranged packages, a
parcel which contained the rich mass of beautiful black
tresses.&nbsp; 'Ah! her head looked so noble,' he added, 'that I
felt it profane to let my scissors touch those locks; but she said
that she could never wear them openly more, and that they did but
take up her time, and were useless to her child and her father--as
she called him; and she much needed the medicaments for the old man
that I gave her in exchange.'</p>

<p>'Heavens!&nbsp; A daughter of Ribaumont!' sighed the Chevalier,
clenching his hand.&nbsp; 'And now, man, let me see the jewels with
which the besotted child parted.'</p>

<p>The jewels were not many, nor remarkable.&nbsp; No one but a
member of the family would have identified them, and not one of the
pearls was there; and the Chevalier refrained from inquiring after
them, lest, by putting the Italian on the scent of anything so
exceptionally valuable, he should defeat his own object, and lead
to the man's securing the pearls and running away with them.&nbsp;
But Ercole understood his glance, with the quickness of a man whose
trade forced him to read countenances.&nbsp; 'The Eccellenza is
looking for the pearls of Ribaumont?&nbsp; The lady made no offer
of them to me.'</p>

<p>'Do you believe that she has them still?'</p>

<p>'I am certain of it, sir.&nbsp; I know that she has
jewels--though she said not what they were--which she preserved at
the expense of her hair.&nbsp; It was thus.&nbsp; The old man had,
it seems, been for weeks on the rack with pains caught by a chill
when they fled from La Sablerie, and, though the fever had left
him, he was still so stiff in the joints as to be unable to
move.&nbsp; I prescribed for him unguents of balm and Indian spice,
which, as the Eccellenza knows, are worth far more than their
weight in gold; nor did these jewels make up the cost of these,
together with the warm cloak for him, and the linen for her child
that she had been purchasing.&nbsp; I tell you, sir, the babe must
have no linen but the finest fabric of Cambrai--yes, and even
carnation-coloured ribbons--though, for herself, I saw the homespun
she was sewing.&nbsp; As she mused over what she could throw back,
I asked if she had no other gauds to make up the price, and she
said, almost within herself, "They are my child's, not mine."&nbsp;
Then remembering that I had been buying the hair of the peasant
maidens, she suddenly offered me her tresses.&nbsp; But I could yet
secure the pearls, if Eccellenza would.'</p>

<p>'Do you then believe her to be in any positive want or
distress?' said the Chevalier.</p>

<p>'Signor, no.&nbsp; The heretical households among whom she
travels gladly support the families of their teachers, and at
Catholic inns they pay their way.&nbsp; I understood them to be on
their way to a synod of Satan at the nest of heretics, Montauban,
where doubtless the old miscreant would obtain an appointment to
some village.'</p>

<p>'When did you thus full in with them?'</p>

<p>'It was on one of the days of the week of Pentecost,' said
Ercole.&nbsp; 'It is at that time I frequent fairs in those parts,
to gather my little harvest on the maidens' heads.'</p>

<p>'<i>Parbleu</i>! class not my niece with those sordid beings,
man,' said the Chevalier, angrily.&nbsp; 'Here is your
price'--tossing a heavy purse on the table--'and as much more shall
await you when you bring me sure intelligence where to find my
niece.&nbsp; You understand; and mark, not one word of the
gentleman you saw here.&nbsp; You say she believes him dead?'</p>

<p>'The Illustrissimo must remember that she never dropped her
disguise with me, but I fully think that she supposed herself a
widow.&nbsp; And I understand the Eccellenza, she is still to think
so.&nbsp; I may be depended on.'</p>

<p>'You understand,' repeated the Chevalier, 'this sum shall reward
you when you have informed me where to find her--as a man like you
can easily trace her from Montauban.&nbsp; If you have any
traffickings with her, it shall be made worth your while to secure
the pearls for the family; but, remember, the first object is
herself, and that she should be ignorant of the existence of him
whom she fancied her husband.'</p>

<p>'I see, Signor; and not a word, of course, of my having come
from you.&nbsp; I will discover her, and leave her noble family to
deal with her.&nbsp; Has the Illustrissimo any further
commands?'</p>

<p>'None,' began the Chevalier; then, suddenly, 'This unhappy
infant-- is it healthy?&nbsp; Did it need any of your
treatment?'</p>

<p>'Signor, no.&nbsp; It was a fair, healthy bambina of a year old,
and I heard the mother boasting that it had never had a day's
illness.'</p>

<p>'Ah, the less a child has to do in the world, the more is it
bent on living,' said the Chevalier with a sigh; and then, with a
parting greeting, he dismissed the Italian, but only to sup under
the careful surveillance of the steward, and then to be conveyed by
early morning light beyond the territory where the affairs of
Ribaumont were interesting.</p>

<p>But the Chevalier went through a sleepless night.&nbsp; Long did
he pace up and down his chamber, grind his teeth, clench his fist
and point them at his head, and make gestures of tearing his thin
gray locks; and many a military oath did he swear under his breath
as he thought to what a pass things had come.&nbsp; His brother's
daughter waiting on an old Huguenot <i>bourgeois</i>, making
sugar-cakes, selling her hair!&nbsp; And what next?&nbsp; Here was
she alive after all, alive and disgracing herself; alive--yes, both
she and her husband--to perplex the Chevalier, and force him either
to new crimes or to beggar his son!&nbsp; Why could not the one
have really died on the St.&nbsp; Bartholomew, or the other at La
Sablerie, instead of putting the poor Chevalier in the wrong by
coming to live again?</p>

<p>What had he done to be thus forced to peril his soul at his
age?&nbsp; Ah, had he but known what he should bring on himself
when he wrote the unlucky letter, pretending that the silly little
child wished to dissolve the marriage!&nbsp; How should he have
known that the lad would come meddling over?&nbsp; And then, when
he had dexterously brought about that each should be offended with
the other, and consent to the separation, why must royalty step in
and throw them together again?&nbsp; Yes, and he surely had a right
to feel ill-used, since it was in ignorance of the ratification of
the marriage that he had arranged the frustration of the elopement,
and that he had forced on the wedding with Narcisse, so as to drive
Eustacie to flight from the convent--in ignorance again of her life
that he had imprisoned Berenger, and tried to buy off his clams to
Nid de Merle with Diane's hand.&nbsp; Circumstances had used him
cruelly, and he shrank from fairly contemplating the next step.</p>

<p>He knew well enough what it must be.&nbsp; Without loss of time
a letter must be sent to Rome, backed by strong interest, so as to
make it appear that the ceremony at Montpipeau, irregular, and
between a Huguenot and Catholic, had been a defiance of the Papal
decree, and must therefore be nullified.&nbsp; This would probably
be attainable, though he did not feel absolutely secure of
it.&nbsp; Pending this, Eustacie must be secluded in a convent;
and, while still believing herself a widow, must immediately on the
arrival of the decree and dispensation, be forced into the marriage
with Narcisse before she heard of Berenger's being still
alive.&nbsp; And then Berenger would have no longer any excuse for
holding out.&nbsp; His claims would be disposed of, and he might be
either sent to England, or he might be won upon by Madame de
Selinville's constancy.</p>

<p>And this, as the Chevalier believed, was the only chance of
saving a life that he was unwilling to sacrifice, for his captive's
patience and courtesy had gained so much upon his heart that he was
resolved to do all that shuffling and temporizing could do to save
the lad from Narcisse's hatred and to secure him Diane's love.</p>

<p>As to telling the truth and arranging his escape, that scarcely
ever crossed the old man's mind.&nbsp; It would have been to resign
the lands of Nid de Merle, to return to the makeshift life he knew
but too well, and, what was worse, to ruin and degrade his son, and
incur his resentment.&nbsp; It would probably be easy to obtain a
promise from Berenger, in his first joy and gratitude, of yielding
up all pretensions of his own or his wife's; but, however
honourably meant, such a promise would be worth very little, and
would be utterly scorned by Narcisse.&nbsp; Besides, how could he
thwart the love of his daughter and the ambition of his son both at
once?</p>

<p>No; the only security for the possession of Nid de Merle lay in
either the death of the young baron and his child or else in his
acquiescence in the invalidity of his marriage, and therefore in
the illegitimacy of the child.</p>

<p>And it was within the bounds of possibility that, in his
seclusion, he might at length learn to believe in the story of the
destruction at La Sablerie, and, wearying of captivity, might yield
at length to the persuasions of Diane and her father, and become so
far involved with them as to be unable to draw back, or else be so
stung by Eustacie's desertion as to accept her rival willingly.</p>

<p>It was a forlorn hope, but it was the only medium that lay
between either the death or the release of the captive; and
therefore the old man clung to it as almost praiseworthy, and did
his best to bring it about by keeping his daughter ignorant that
Eustacie lived, and writing to his son that the Baron was on the
point of becoming a Catholic and marrying his sister: and thus that
all family danger and scandal would be avoided, provided the matter
were properly represented at Rome.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.&nbsp; 'JAM SATIS'</h3>

<p>You may go walk, and give me leave a while,</p>

<p>My lessons make no music in three parts.</p>

<p>TAMING OF THE SHREW</p>

<p>Whether the dark pool really showed Sir Marmaduke Thistlewood or
not, at the moment that his son desired that his image should be
called up, the good knight was, in effect, sitting nodding over the
tankard of sack with which his supper was always concluded, while
the rest of the family, lured out of the sunny hall by the charms
of a fresh summer evening, had dispersed into the gardens or
hall.</p>

<p>Presently a movement in the neighbourhood made him think it
incumbent on him to open his eyes wide, and exclaim, 'I'm not
asleep.'</p>

<p>'Oh no! you never are asleep when there's anything you ought to
see!' returned Dame Annora, who was standing by him with her hand
on his chair.</p>

<p>'How now?&nbsp; Any tidings of the lads?' he exclaimed.</p>

<p>'Of the lads?&nbsp; No, indeed; but there will be bad tidings
for the lads if you do not see to it!&nbsp; Where do you think your
daughter is, Sir Duke?'</p>

<p>'Where?&nbsp; How should I know?&nbsp; She went out to give her
sisters some strawberries, I thought.'</p>

<p>'See here,' said Lady Thistlewood, leading the way to the north
end of the hall, where a door opened into what was called the
Yew-tree Grove.&nbsp; This consisted of five rows of yew-trees,
planted at regular intervals, and their natural mode of growth so
interfered with by constant cutting, that their ruddy trunks had
been obliged to rise branchless, till about twelve feet above
ground they had been allowed to spread out their limbs in the form
of ordinary forest trees; and, altogether, their foliage became a
thick, unbroken, dark, evergreen roof, impervious to sunshine, and
almost impervious to rain, while below their trunks were like
columns forming five arcades, floored only by that dark red crusty
earth and green lichen growth that seems peculiar to the shelter of
yew-trees.&nbsp; The depth of the shade and the stillness of the
place made it something peculiarly soothing and quiet, more
especially when, as now, the sunset light came below the branches,
richly tinted the russet pillars, cast long shadows, and gleamed
into all the recesses of the interlacing boughs and polished
leafage above.</p>

<p>'Do you see, Sir Duke?' demanded his lady.</p>

<p>'I see my little maids making a rare feast under the trees upon
their strawberries set out on leaves.&nbsp; Bless their little
hearts!&nbsp; what a pretty fairy feast they've made of it, with
the dogs looking on as grave as judges!&nbsp; It takes me young
again to get a smack of the haut-bois your mother brought from
Chelsea Gardens.'</p>

<p>'Haut-bois!&nbsp; He'd never see if the house ere afire
overhead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What's that beyond?'</p>

<p>'No fire, my dear, but the sky all aglow with sunset, and the
red cow standing up against the light, chewing her cud, and looking
as well pleased as though she knew there wasn't her match in
Dorset.'</p>

<p>Lady Thistlewood fairly stamped, and pointed with her fan, like
a pistol, down a side aisle of the grove, where two figures were
slowly moving along.</p>

<p>'Eh! what?&nbsp; Lucy with her apron full of rose-leaves,
letting them float away while she cons the children's lesson for
the morrow with Merrycourt?&nbsp; They be no great loss, when the
place is full of roses.&nbsp; Or why could you not call to the
wench to take better heed of them, instead of making all this
pother?'</p>

<p>'A pretty sort of lesson it is like to be! A pretty sort of
return for my poor son, unless you take the better heed!'</p>

<p>'Would that I saw any return at all for either of the poor dear
lads,' sighed the knight wearily; 'but what you may be driving at I
cannot perceive.'</p>

<p>'What!&nbsp; When 'tis before your very eyes, how yonder
smooth-tongued French impostor, after luring him back to his ruin
beyond seas, is supplanting him even here, and your daughter giving
herself over to the wily viper!'</p>

<p>'The man is a popish priest,' said Sir Marmaduke; 'no more given
to love than Mr. Adderley or Friar Rogers.'</p>

<p>The dame gave a snort of derision:' Prithee, how many popish
priests be now wedded parsons?&nbsp; Nor, indeed, even if his story
be true, do I believe he is a priest at all.&nbsp; I have seen many
a young abbe, as they call themselves, clerk only in name,
loitering at court, free to throw off the cassock any moment they
chose, and as insolent as the rest.&nbsp; Why, the Abbe de
Lorraine, cardinal that is now, said of my complexion---'</p>

<p>'No vows, quotha!' muttered Sir Marmaduke, well aware of the
Cardinal de Lorraine's opinion of his lady's complexion.&nbsp; 'So
much the better; he is too good a young fellow to be forced to mope
single, and yet I hate men's breaking their word.'</p>

<p>'And that's all you have to say!' angrily cried her
ladyship.&nbsp; 'No one save myself ever thinks how it is to be
with my poor dear wounded, heart-broken son, when he comes home, to
find himself so scurvily used by that faithless girl of yours,
ready---'</p>

<p>'Hold, madam,' said Sir Marmaduke, with real sternness; 'nothing
rash against my daughter.&nbsp; How should she be faithless to a
man who has been wedded ever since she knew him?'</p>

<p>'He is free now,' said Lady Thistlewood, beginning to cry (for
the last letters received from Berenger had been those from Paris,
while he still believed Eustacie to have perished at La
Sablerie);</p>

<p>'and I do say it is very hard that just when he is&nbsp; rid of
the French baggage, the bane of his life, and is coming home, maybe
with a child upon his hands, and all wounded, scarred, and blurred,
the only wench he would or should have married should throw herself
away on a French vagabond beggar, and you aiding and abetting.'</p>

<p>'Come, come, Dame Nan,' said Sir Marmaduke, 'who told you I was
aiding and abetting?'</p>

<p>'Tell me not, Sir Duke, you that see them a courting under your
very eyes, and will not stir a finger to hinder it.&nbsp; If you
like to see your daughter take up with a foreign adventurer, why,
she's no child of mine, thank Heaven! And I've nought to do with
it.'</p>

<p>'Pshaw, dame, there's no taking up in the case; and if there
were, sure it is not you that should be hard on Lucy.'</p>

<p>Whereupon Annora fell into such a flood of tears at the cruelty
of casting such things up to her, that Sir Marmaduke was fain in
his blundering way to declare that he only meant that an honest
Englishman had no chance where a Frenchman once came in, and then
very nearly to surrender at discretion.&nbsp; At any rate, he
escaped from her tears by going out at the door, and calling to
Lucy to mind her rose-leaves; then, as she gazed round, dismayed at
the pink track along the ground, he asked her what she had been
doing.&nbsp; Whereto she answered with bright face and honest eyes,
that Mr.&nbsp; Mericour had been going over with her the ode <i>
'Jam satis</i>,' of Horatius, wherewith to prepare little Nan for
him to-morrow, and then she ran hurriedly away to secure the
remainder of the rose-leaves, while her companion was already on
his knees picking up the petals she had dropped.</p>

<p>'Master Merrycourt,' said Sir Marmaduke, a little gruffly,
'never heed the flower-leaves.&nbsp; I want a word with you.'</p>

<p>Claude de Mericour rose hastily, as if somewhat struck by the
tone.</p>

<p>'The matter is this,' said the knight, leading him from the
house, and signing back the little girls who had sprung towards
them--'it has been brought to my mind that you are but a youth,
and, pardon me, my young master, but when lads and lasses have
their heads together over one book, tongues wag.'</p>

<p>The colour rushed hotly into young Mericour's face, and he
answered quickly, 'My rank--I mean my order--should answer
that.'</p>

<p>'Stay, young man, we are not in France; your order, be it what
it may, has not hindered many a marriage in England; though, look
you, no man should ever wed with my consent who broke his word to
God in so doing; but they tell me your vows are not always made at
your age.'</p>

<p>'Nor are they,' exclaimed Mericour, in a low voice, but with a
sudden light on his countenance.&nbsp; 'The tonsure was given me as
a child, but no vow of celibacy has passed my lips.'</p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke exclaimed, 'Oh!--' with a prolongation of the
sound that lasted till Mericour began again.</p>

<p>'But, sir, let tongues wag as they will, it is for nought.&nbsp;
Your fair daughter was but as ever preparing beforehand with me the
tasks with which she so kindly indoctrinates her little
sisters.&nbsp; I never thought of myself as aught but a religious,
and should never dream of human love.'</p>

<p>'I thought so! I said so!' said Sir Marmaduke, highly
gratified.&nbsp; 'I knew you were an honourable man that would
never speak of love to my daughter by stealth, nor without means to
maintain her after her birth.'</p>

<p>The word 'birth' brought the blood into the face of the son of
the peer of France, but he merely bowed with considerable stiffness
and pride, saying, 'You did me justice, sir.'</p>

<p>'Come, don't be hurt, man,' said Sir Marmaduke, putting his hand
on his shoulder.&nbsp; 'I told you I knew you for an honourable
man!&nbsp; You'll be over here to-morrow to hear the little maids
their <i>Jam satis</i>, or whatever you call it, and dine with us
after to taste Lucy's handiwork in jam cranberry, a better thing as
I take it.'</p>

<p>Mericour had recovered himself, smiled, shook the good Sir
Marmaduke proffered hand, and, begging to excuse himself from
bidding good night to the ladies on the score of lateness, he
walked away to cross the downs on his return to Combe Walwyn, where
he was still resident, according to the arrangement by which he was
there to await Berenger's return, now deferred so much beyond all
reasonable expectation.</p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke, with a free heart, betook himself to the house,
dreading to find that Lucy had fallen under the objurgations of her
step-mother, but feeling impelled to stand her protector, and
guided to the spot by the high key of Dame Annora's voice.</p>

<p>He found Lucy--who, on the race occasions when good-natured Lady
Thistlewood was really angry with her, usually cowered meekly--now
standing her ground, and while the dame was pausing for breath, he
heard her gentle voice answering steadily, 'No, madam, to him I
could never owe faith, nor troth, nor love, save such as I have for
Philip.'</p>

<p>'Then it is very unfeeling and ungrateful of you.&nbsp; Nor did
you think so once, but it is all his scars and---'</p>

<p>By this time Sir Marmaduke had come near enough to put his arm
round his daughter, and say, 'No such thing, dame.&nbsp; It had
been unseemly in the lass had it been otherwise.&nbsp; She is a
good girl and a discreet; and the Frenchman, if he has made none of
their vows, feels as bound as though he had.&nbsp; He's an honest
fellow, thinking of his studies and not of ladies or any such
trumpery.&nbsp; So give me a kiss, Lucy girl, and thou shalt study
<i>Jam satis</i>, or any other jam he pleases, without more to vex
thee.'</p>

<p>Lucy, now that the warfare was over, had begun to weep so
profusely that so soon as her father released her, she turned, made
a mute gesture to ask permission to depart, and hurried away; while
Lady Thistlewood, who disliked above all that her husband should
think her harsh to her step-children, began to relate the exceeding
tenderness of the remonstrance which had been followed with such
disproportionate floods of tears.</p>

<p>Poor Sir Marmaduke hoped at least that the veil of night had put
an end to the subject which harassed him at a time when he felt
less capable than usual of bearing vexation, for he was yearning
sadly after his only son.&nbsp; The youths had been absent ten
months, and had not been heard of for more than three, when they
were just leaving Paris in search of the infant.&nbsp; Sir Francis
Walsingham, whose embassy had ended with the death of Charles IX.,
knew nothing of them, and great apprehensions respecting them were
beginning to prevail, and, to Sir Marmaduke especially, seemed to
be eating out the peace and joy of his life.&nbsp; Philip, always
at his father's side ever since he could run alone, was missed at
every visit to stable or kennel; the ring of his cheery voice was
wanting to the house; and the absence of his merry whistle seemed
to make Sir Marmaduke's heart sink like lead as he donned his heavy
boots, and went forth in the silver dew of the summer morning to
judge which of his cornfields would soonest be ready for the
sickle.&nbsp; Until this expedition of his sons he had, for more
than fourteen years never been alone in those morning rounds on his
farm; and much as he loved his daughters, they seemed to weigh very
light in the scale compared with the sturdy heir who loved every
acre with his own ancestral love.&nbsp; Indeed, perhaps, Sir
Marmaduke had deeper, fonder affection for the children of his
first marriage, because he had barely been able to give his full
heart to their mother before she was taken from him, and he had
felt almost double tenderness to be due to them, when he at length
obtained his first and only true love.&nbsp; Now, as he looked over
the shinning billows of the waving barley, his heart was very sore
with longing for Philip's gladsome shout at the harvest-field, and
he thought with surprise and compunction how he had seen Lucy leave
him struggling with a flood of tears.&nbsp; While he was still thus
gazing, a head appeared in the narrow path that led across the
fields, and presently he recognized the slender, upright form of
the young Frenchman.</p>

<p>'A fair good morrow to you, Master Merrycourt!&nbsp; You come
right early to look after your ode?'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Mericour, gravely saluting him, 'I come to make you
my confession.&nbsp; I find that I did not deal truly with you last
night, but it was all unwittingly.'</p>

<p>'How?' exclaimed Sir Marmaduke, recollecting Lucy's tears and
looking much startled.&nbsp; 'You have not---' and there he broke
off, seeing Mericour eager to speak.</p>

<p>'Sir,' he said, 'I was bred as one set apart from love.&nbsp; I
had never learnt to think it possible to me,--I thought so even
when I replied to you last evening; but, sir, the words you then
spoke, the question you asked me set my heart burning, and my
senses whirling---'&nbsp; And between agitation and confusion he
stammered and clasped his hands passionately, trying to continue
what he was saying, but muttering nothing intelligible.</p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke filled up the interval with a long whistle of
perplexity; but, too kind not to pity the youth's distress, he laid
his hand on his shoulder, saying, 'You found out you were but a
hot-blooded youth after all, but an honest one.&nbsp; For, as I
well trust, my lass knows nought of this.'</p>

<p>'How should she know, sir, what I knew not myself?'</p>

<p>'Ha! ha!' chuckled Sir Duke to himself, 'so 'twas all Dame Nan's
doing that the flame has been lighted!&nbsp; Ho! ho!&nbsp; But what
is to come next is the question?' and he eyed the French youth from
head to foot with the same considering look with which he was wont
to study a bullock.</p>

<p>'Sir, sir,' cried Mericour, absolutely flinging himself on his
knee before him with national vehemence, 'do give me hope!&nbsp;
Oh! I will bless you, I will---'</p>

<p>'Get up, man,' said the knight, hastily; 'no fooling of this
sort.&nbsp; The milkmaids will be coming.&nbsp; Hope--why, what
sort of hope can be given you in the matter?' he continued; 'you
are a very good lad, and I like you well enough, but you are not
the sort of stuff one gives one's daughter to.&nbsp; Ay, ay, I know
you are a great man in your own country, but what are you
here?'</p>

<p>'A miserable fugitive and beggar, I know that,' said Mericour,
vehemently, 'but let me have but hope, and there is nothing I will
not be!'</p>

<p>'Pish!' said Sir Marmaduke.</p>

<p>'Hear me,' entreated the youth, recalled to common sense: 'you
know that I have lingered at the chateau yonder, partly to study
divinity and settle my mind, and partly because my friend Ribaumont
begged me to await his return.&nbsp; I will be no longer idle; my
mind is fixed.&nbsp; To France I cannot return, while she gives me
no choice between such doctrine and practice as I saw at court, and
such as the Huguenots would have imposed on me.&nbsp; I had already
chosen England as my country before--before this wild hope had
awakened in me.&nbsp; Here, I know my nobility counts for nothing,
though, truly, sir, few names in France are prouder.&nbsp; But it
shall be no hindrance.&nbsp; I will become one of your men of the
robe.&nbsp; I have heard that they can enrich themselves and
intermarry with your country <i>noblesse</i>.'</p>

<p>'True, true,' said Sir Marmaduke, 'there is more sense in that
notion than there seemed to be in you at first.&nbsp; My poor
brother Phil was to have been a lawyer if he had lived, but it
seems to me you are a long way off from that yet!&nbsp; Why, our
Templars be mostly Oxford scholars.'</p>

<p>'So it was explained to me,' said Mericour, 'but for some weeks
past the Lady Burnet, to whose sons, as you know, I have been
teaching French, has been praying me to take the charge of them at
Oxford, by which means I should at least be there maintained, and
perchance obtain the means for carrying on my studies at the
Temple.'</p>

<p>'Not ill thought of,' said the knight; 'a fair course enough for
you; but look you, you must have good luck indeed to be in a state
to marry within ten or fifteen years,--very likely not then--having
nothing of your own, and my wench but little, for Lucy's portion
cannot be made equal to her sisters', her mother having been no
heiress like Dame Nan.&nbsp; And would you have me keep the maid
unwedded till she be thirty or thirty-five years old, waiting for
your fortune?'</p>

<p>Mericour looked terribly disconcerted at this.</p>

<p>'Moreover,' added the knight, 'they will all be at me, so soon
as those poor lads come home--Heaven grant they do--to give her to
Berenger.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Mericour, looking up with a sudden smile, 'all that
I would ask is, what you are too good a father to do, that you
would not put any force on her inclinations.'</p>

<p>'How now? you said you had never courted her!'</p>

<p>'Nor have I, sir.&nbsp; But I see the force of your words.&nbsp;
Should she love another man, my dream were, of course, utterly
vain, but if not---'&nbsp; He broke off.</p>

<p>'Well, well, I am no man to force a girl to a match against her
will; but never trust to that, man. &nbsp;I know what women are;
and let a fantastic stranger come across them, there's an end of
old friends.&nbsp; But yours is an honest purpose, and you are a
good youth; and if you had anything to keep her with, you should
have Lucy to-morrow, with all my heart.'</p>

<p>Then came the further question whether Mericour should be
allowed an interview with Lucy.&nbsp; Sir Marmaduke was simple
enough to fancy that she need not be made aware of the cause of
Mericour's new arrangement, and decided against it.&nbsp; The young
man sorrowfully acquiesced, but whether such a secret could be kept
was another thing.&nbsp; To him it would have been impossible to
renew their former terms of intercourse without betraying his
feelings, and he therefore absented himself.&nbsp; Lady Thistlewood
triumphed openly in Sir Marmaduke's having found him out and
banished him from the house; Lucy looked white and shed silent
tears.&nbsp; Her father's soft heart was moved, and one Sunday
evening he whispered into her ear that Dame Nan was all wrong, and
Mericour only kept away because he was an honourable man.&nbsp;
Then Lucy smiled and brightened, and Sir Duke fondly asked her if
she were fool enough to fancy herself in love with the man.</p>

<p>'Oh no, how should she, when he had never named love to
her?&nbsp; She was only glad her father esteemed him.'</p>

<p>So then foolish, fond Sir Marmaduke told her all that had
passed, and if it had not been too late, he would have sent for
Mericour from Lady Burnet's; but his own story did almost as well
in bringing back Lucy's soft pink colour.&nbsp; She crept up into
Cecily's room one day, and found that she knew all about it, and
was as kind and sympathizing as she could be--when a vocation had
been given up, though no vows had been taken.&nbsp; She did not
quite understand it, but she would take it on trust.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.&nbsp; THE SCANDAL OF THE SYNOD OF
MONTAUBAN</h3>

<p>O ye, wha are sae guid yourself,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sae pious and sae holy,</p>

<p>Ye've naught to do but mark and tell</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your neebour's fauts and folly.--BURNS</p>

<p>The old city of Montauban, once famous as the home of Ariosto's
Rinaldo and his brethren, known to French romance as <i>'Les Quatre
Fils Aymon</i>,' acquired in later times a very diverse species of
fame,--that, namely, of being one of the chief strong-holds of the
Reformed.&nbsp; The Bishop Jean de Lettes, after leading a
scandalous life, had professed a sort of Calvinism, had married,
and retired to Geneva, and his successor had not found it possible
to live at Montauban from the enmity of the inhabitants.&nbsp;
Strongly situated, with a peculiar municipal constitution of its
own, and used to Provencal independence both of thought and deed,
the inhabitants had been so unanimous in their Calvinism, and had
offered such efficient resistance, as to have wrung from Government
reluctant sanction for the open observance of the Reformed worship,
and for the maintenance of a college for the education of their
ministry.</p>

<p>There then was convoked the National Synod, answering to the
Scottish General Assembly, excepting that the persecuted French
Presbyterians met in a different place every year.&nbsp; Delegated
pastors there gathered from every quarter.&nbsp; From Northern
France came men used to live in constant hazard of their lives;
from Paris, confessors such as Merlin, the chaplain who, leaving
Coligny's bedside, had been hidden for three days in a hayloft,
feeding on the eggs that a hen daily laid beside him;
army-chaplains were there who had passionately led battle-psalms
ere their colleagues charged the foe, and had striven with vain
endeavours to render their soldiers saints; while other pastors
came from Pyrenean villages where their generation had never seen
flames lighted against heresy, nor knew what it was to disperse a
congregation in haste and secrecy for hear of the enemy.</p>

<p>The audience was large and sympathizing.&nbsp; Montauban had
become the refuge of many Huguenot families who could nowhere else
profess their faith without constant danger; and a large proportion
of these were ladies, wives of gentlemen in the army kept up by La
Noue, or widows who feared that their children might be taken from
them to be brought up by their Catholic relations, elderly dames
who longed for tranquillity after having lost husbands or sons by
civil war.&nbsp; Thickly they lodged in the strangely named <i>
gasches</i> and <i>vertiers</i>, as the divisions and subdivisions
of the city were termed, occupying floors or apartments of the tall
old houses; walking abroad in the streets in grave attire, stiff
hat, crimped ruff, and huge fan, and forming a society in
themselves, close-packed, punctilious and dignified, rigidly devout
but strictly censorious, and altogether as unlike their typical
country folks of Paris as if they had belonged to a different
nation.&nbsp; And the sourest and most severe of all were such as
had lived farthest south, and personally suffered the least peril
and alarm.</p>

<p>Dancing was unheard-of enormity; cards and dice were prohibited;
and stronger expletive than the elegant ones invented for the
special use of the King of Navarre was expiated either by the purse
or the skin; Marot's psalmody was the only music, black or sad
colour the only wear; and, a few years later, the wife of one of
the most distinguished statesmen and councillors of Henri of
Navarre was excommunicated for the enormity of wearing her hair
curled.</p>

<p>To such a community it was a delightful festival to receive a
national assembly of ministers ready to regale them on daily
sermons for a whole month, and to retail in private the points of
discipline debated in the public assembly; and, apart from mere
eagerness for novelty, many a discreet heart beat with gladness at
the meeting with the hunted pastor of her native home, who had been
the first to strike the spiritual chord, and awake her mind to
religion.</p>

<p>Every family had their honoured guest, every reception-room was
in turn the scene of some pious little assembly that drank <i>eau
sucree</i>, and rejoiced in its favourite pastor; and each little
congress indulged in gentle scandal against its rival
coterie.&nbsp; But there was one point on which all the ladies
agreed,--namely, that good Maitre Isaac Gardon had fallen into an
almost doting state of blindness to the vanities of his
daughter-in-law, and that she was a disgrace to the community, and
ought to be publicly reprimanded.</p>

<p>Isaac Gardon, long reported to have been martyred--some said at
Paris, others averred at La Sablerie--had indeed been welcomed with
enthusiastic joy and veneration, when he made his appearance at
Montauban, pale, aged, bent, leaning on a staff, and showing the
dire effect of the rheumatic fever which had prostrated him after
the night of drenching and exposure during the escape from La
Sablerie.&nbsp; Crowded as the city was, there was a perfect
competition among the tradesfolk for the honour of entertaining him
and the young widow and child of a St. Bartholomew martyr.&nbsp; A
cordwainer of the street of the Soubirous Hauts obtained this
honour, and the wife, though speaking only the sweet Provencal
tongue, soon established the most friendly relations with M.
Gardon's daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>Two or three more pastors likewise lodged in the same house, and
ready aid was given by Mademoiselle Gardon, as all called Eustacie,
in the domestic cares thus entailed, while her filial attention to
her father-in-law and her sweet tenderness to her child struck all
this home circle with admiration.&nbsp; Children of that age were
seldom seen at home among the better classes in towns.&nbsp; Then,
as now, they were universally consigned to country nurses, who only
brought them home at three or four years old, fresh from a squalid,
neglected cottage life: and Eustacie's little moonbeam, <i>la
petite Rayonette</i>, as she loved to call her, was quite an
unusual spectacle; and from having lived entirely with grown
people, and enjoyed the most tender and dainty care, she was
intelligent and brightly docile to a degree that appeared
marvellous to those who only saw children stupefied by a contrary
system. She was a lovely little thing, exquisitely fair, and her
plump white limbs small but perfectly moulded; she was always
happy, because always healthy, and living in an atmosphere of love;
and she was the pet and wonder of all the household, from the
grinning apprentice to the grave young candidate who hoped to be
elected pastor to the Duke de Quinet's village in the Cevennes.</p>

<p>And yet it was <i>la petite Rayonette</i> who first brought her
mother into trouble.&nbsp; Since her emancipation from swaddling
clothes she had been equipped in a little gray woollen frock, such
as Eustacie had learnt to knit among the peasants, and varied with
broad while stripes which gave it something of the moonbeam effect;
but the mother had not been able to resist the pleasure of drawing
up the bosom and tying it with a knot of the very carnation colour
that Berenger used to call her own.&nbsp; That knot was discussed
all up and down the Rue Soubirous Hauts, and even through the
Carriera Major!&nbsp; The widow of an old friend of Maitre Gardon
had remonstrated on the improprieties of such gay vanities, and
Mdlle. Gardon had actually replied, reddening with insolences, that
her husband had loved to see her wear the colour.</p>

<p>Now, if the brethren at Paris had indulged their daughters in
such backslidings, see what had come of it!&nbsp; But that poor
Theodore Gardon should have admired his bride in such unhallowed
adornments, was an evident calumny; and many a head was shaken over
it in grave and pious assembly.</p>

<p>Worse still; when she had been invited to a supper at the
excellent Madame Fargeau's, the presumptuous little <i>
bourgeoise</i> had evidently not known her place, but had seated
herself as if she were a noble lady, a <i>fille de qualite</i>,
instead of a mere minister's widow and a watchmaker's
daughter.&nbsp; Pretend ignorance that precedence was to be here
observed!&nbsp; That was another Parisian piece of impudence, above
all in one who showed such ridiculous airs as to wipe her face with
her own handkerchief instead of the table-cloth, and to be
reluctant to help herself from the genera dish of <i>potage</i>
with her own spoon.&nbsp; Even that might have been overlooked if
she would have regaled them with a full and particular account of
her own rescue from the massacre at Paris; but she merely coloured
up, and said that she had been so ill as to know scarcely anything
about it; and when they pressed her further, she shortly said,
'They locked me up;' and, before she could be cross-examined as to
who was this 'they,' Maitre Gardon interfered, saying that she had
suffered so much that he requested the subject might never be
mentioned to her.&nbsp; Nor would he be more explicit, and there
was evidently some mystery, and he was becoming blindly indulgent
and besotted by the blandishments of an artful woman.</p>

<p>Eustacie was saved from hearing the gossip by her ignorance of
the Provencal, which was the only languages of all but the highest
and most cultivated classes, the hostess had very little <i>langue
d'oui</i>, and never ventured on any complicated discourse; and
Isaac Gardon, who could speak both the <i>oc</i> and <i>oui</i>,
was not a person whom it was easy to beset with mere hearsay or
petty remonstrance, but enough reached him at last to make him one
day say mildly, 'My dear child, might not the little one dispense
with her ribbon while we are here?'</p>

<p>'Eh, father?&nbsp; At the bidding of those impertinents?'</p>

<p>'Take care, daughter; you were perfect with the tradesfolk and
peasants, but you cannot comport yourself as successfully with this
<i>petite noblesse</i>, or the pastors' wives.'</p>

<p>'They are insolent, father.&nbsp; I, in my own true person,
would treat no one as these petty dames treat me,' said
Eustacie.&nbsp; 'I would not meddle between a peasant woman and her
child, nor ask questions that must needs wring her heart.'</p>

<p>'Ah, child! humility is a bitter lesson; and even this world
needs it now from you.&nbsp; We shall have suspicions; and I heard
to-day that the King is in Dauphiny, and with him M. de Nid de
Merle.&nbsp; Be not alarmed; he has no force with him, and the
peace still subsists; but we must avoid suspicion.&nbsp; There is a
<i>preche</i> at the Moustier to-day, in French; it would be well
if you were to attend it.'</p>

<p>'I understand as little of French sermons as of Provencal,'
murmured Eustacie; but it was only a murmur.</p>

<p>Maitre Gardon had soon found out that his charge had not head
enough to be made a thorough-going controversial Calvinist.&nbsp;
Clever, intelligent, and full of resources as she was, she had no
capacity for argument, and could not enter into theoretical
religion.&nbsp; Circumstances had driven her from her original
Church and alienated her from those who had practiced such personal
cruelties on her and hers, but the mould of her mind remained what
it had been previously; she clung to the Huguenots because they
protected her from those who would have forced an abhorrent
marriage on her and snatched her child from her; and, personally,
she loved and venerated Isaac Gardon with ardent, self-sacrificing
filial love and gratitude, accepted as truth all that came from his
lips, read the Scriptures, sang and prayed with him, and obeyed him
as dutifully as ever the true Esperance could have done; but,
except the merest external objections against the grossest and most
palpable popular corruptions and fallacies, she really never
entered into the matter.&nbsp; She had been left too ignorant of
her own system to perceive its true clams upon her; and though she
could not help preferring High Mass to a Calvinist assembly, and
shrinking with instinctive pain and horror at the many profanations
she witnessed, the really spiritual leadings of her own individual
father-like leader had opened so much that was new and precious to
her, so full of truth, so full of comfort, giving so much moral
strength, that, unaware that all the foundations had been laid by
Mere Monique, the resolute, high-spirited little thing, out of
sheer constancy and constitutional courage, would have laid down
her life as a Calvinist martyr, in profound ignorance that she was
not in the least a Calvinist all the time.</p>

<p>Hitherto, her wandering life amid the persecuted Huguenots of
the West had prevented her from hearing any preaching but good
Isaac's own, which had been rather in the way of comfort and
encouragement than of controversy, but in this great gathering it
was impossible that there should not be plenty of vehement
polemical oratory, such as was sue to fly over that weary little
head.&nbsp; After a specimen or two, the chances of the sermon
being in Provencal, and the necessity of attending to her child,
had been Eustacie's excuse for usually offering to attend to the
<i>menage</i>, and set her hostess free to be present at the
preachings.</p>

<p>However, Rayonette was considered as no valid excuse; for did
not whole circles of black-eyed children sit on the floor in sleepy
stolidity at the feet of their mothers or nurses, and was it not a
mere worldly folly to pretend that a child of sixteen months could
not be brought to church?&nbsp; It was another instance of the
mother's frivolity and the grandfather's idolatry.</p>

<p>The Moustier, or minster, the monastic church of Montauban,
built on Mont Auriol in honour of St. Theodore, had, twelve years
before, been plundered and sacked by the Calvinists, not only out
of zeal for iconoclasm, but from long-standing hatred and jealousy
against the monks. Catherine de Medicis had, in 1546, carried off
two of the jasper columns from its chief door-way to the Louvre;
and, after some years more, it was entirely destroyed.&nbsp; The
grounds of the Auriol Mountain Monastery have been desolate down to
the present day, when they have been formed into public
gardens.&nbsp; When Eustacie walked through them, carrying her
little girl in her arms, a rose in her bosom to console her for the
loss of her bright breast-knot, they were in raw fresh dreariness,
with tottering, blackened cloisters, garden flowers run wild,
images that she had never ceased to regard as sacred lying broken
and defiled among the grass and weeds.</p>

<p>Up the broad path was pacing the municipal procession, headed by
the three Consuls, each with a serjeant bearing a white rod in
front and a scarlet mantle, and the Consuls themselves in long
robes with wide sleeves of quartered black and scarlet, followed by
six halberdiers, likewise in scarlet, blazoned with the shield of
the city--gules, a golden willow-tree, pollarded and shedding its
branches, a chief azure with the three <i>fleur-de-lys</i> of
royalty.&nbsp; As little Rayonette gleefully pointed at the
brilliant pageant, Eustacie could not help saying, rather bitterly,
that these <i>messieurs</i> seemed to wish to engross all the gay
colours from heaven and earth from themselves; and Maitre Isaac
could not help thinking she had some right on her side as he
entered the church once gorgeous with jasper, marbles, and mosaics,
glowing with painted glass, resplendent with gold and jewels, rich
with paintings and draperies of the most brilliant dyes; but now,
all that was, soiled, dulled, defaced; the whole building, even up
to the end of the chancel, was closely fitted with benches occupied
by the 'sad-coloured' congregation.&nbsp; Isaac was obliged by a
strenuous effort of memory to recall 'Ne-hushtan' and the golden
calves, before he could clear from his mind, 'Now they break down
all the carved work thereof with axes and with hammers.'&nbsp; But,
then, did not the thorough going Reformers think Master Isaac a
very weak and back-sliding brother?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in right of his age, his former reputation, and
his sufferings, his place was full in the midst of the
square-capped, black-robed ministers who sat herded on a sort of
platform together, to address the Almighty and the congregation in
prayers and discourses, interspersed with psalms sung by the whole
assembly.&nbsp; There was no want of piety, depth, force, or
fervour.&nbsp; These were men refined by persecution, who had
struggled to the light that had been darkened by the popular
system, and, having once been forced into foregoing their scruples
as to breaking the unity of the Church, regarded themselves even as
apostles of the truth.&nbsp; Listening to them, Isaac Gardon felt
himself rapt into the hopes of cleansing the aspirations of
universal re-integration that had shone before his early youth, ere
the Church had shown herself deaf, and the Reformers in losing
patience had lost purity, and disappointment had crushed him into
an aged man.</p>

<p>He was recalled by the echo of a gay, little inarticulate cry--
those baby tones that had become such music to his ears that he
hardly realized that they were not indeed from his
grandchild.&nbsp; In a moment's glance he saw how it was.&nbsp; A
little bird had flown in at one of the empty window, and was
fluttering over the heads of the congregation, and a small, plump,
white arm and hand was stretched out and pointing--a rosy, fair,
smiling face upturned; a little gray figure had scrambled up on the
knee of one of the still, black-hooded women; and the shout of
irrepressible delight was breaking on the decorum of the
congregation, in spite of hushes, in spite of the uplifted rod of a
scarlet serjeant on his way down the aisle to quell the
disturbance; nay, as the bird came nearer, the exulting voice,
proud of the achievement of a new word, shouted <i>'Moineau,</i>
<i>moineau.</i>.'&nbsp; Angered by defiance to authority, down came
the rod, not indeed with great force, but with enough to make the
arms clasp round the mother's neck, the face hide itself on in, a
loud, terrified wail ring through the church, and tempestuous
sobbing follow it up.&nbsp; Then uprose the black-hooded figure,
the child tightly clasped, and her mantle drawn round it, while the
other hand motioned the official aside, and down the aisle, even to
the door, she swept with the lofty carriage, high-drawn neck, and
swelling bosom of an offended princess.</p>

<p>Maitre Gardon heard little more of the discourse, indeed he
would have followed at once had he not feared to increase the
sensation and the scandal.&nbsp; He came home to find Rayonette's
tears long ago dried, but her mother furious.&nbsp; She would leave
Montauban that minute, she would never set foot in a heretic
conventicle again, to have her fatherless child, daughter of all
the Ribaumonts, struck by base <i>canaille</i>.&nbsp; Even her
uncle could not have done worse; he at least would have respected
her blood.</p>

<p>Maitre Gardon did not know that his charge could be in such a
passion, as, her eyes flashing through tears, she insisted on being
taken away at once.&nbsp; No, she would hear nothing.&nbsp; She
seemed to fell resentment due to the honour of all the Ribaumonts,
and he was obliged peremptorily to refuse to quit Montauban till
his business at the Synod should be completed, and then to leave
her in a flood of angry tears and reproaches for exposing her child
to such usage, and approving it.</p>

<p>Poor little thing, he found her meek and penitent for her unjust
anger towards himself.&nbsp; Whatever he desired she would do, she
would stay or go with him anywhere except to a sermon at the
Moustier, and she did not think that in her heart her good father
desired little infants to be beaten--least of all Berenger's little
one.&nbsp; And with Rayonette already on his knee, stealing his
spectacles, peace was made.</p>

<p>Peace with him, but not with the congregation!&nbsp; Were people
to stalk out of church in a rage, and make no reparation?&nbsp; Was
Maitre Isaac to talk of orphans, only children, and maternal love,
as if weak human affection did not need chastisement?&nbsp; Was
this saucy Parisienne to play the offended, and say that if the
child were not suffered at church she must stay at home with
it?&nbsp; The ladies agitated to have the obnoxious young widow
reprimanded in open Synod, but, to their still greater disgust, not
a pastor would consent to perform the office. Some said that Maitre
Gardon ought to rule his own household, others that they respected
him too much to interfere, and there were others abandoned enough
to assert that if any one needed a reprimand it was the
serjeant.</p>

<p>Of these was the young candidate, Samuel Mace, who had been
educated at the expense of the Dowager Duchess de Quinet, and hoped
that her influence would obtain his election to the pastorate of a
certain peaceful little village deep in the Cevennes.&nbsp; She had
intimated that what he wanted was a wife to teach and improve the
wives of the peasant farmers, and where could a more eligible one
be found than Esperance Gardon?&nbsp; Her cookery he tasted, her
industry he saw, her tenderness to her child, her attention to her
father, were his daily admiration; and her soft velvet eyes and
sweet smile went so deep in his heart that he would have bought her
ells upon ells of pink ribbon, when once out of sight of the old
ladies; would have given a father's love to her little daughter,
and a son's duty and veneration to Isaac Gardon.</p>

<p>His patroness did not deny her approval.&nbsp; The gossip had
indeed reached her, but she had a high esteem for Isaac Gardon,
believed in Samuel Mace's good sense, and heeded Montauban scandal
very little.&nbsp; Her <i>protege</i> would be much better married
to a spirited woman who had seen the world, than to a mere farmer's
daughter who had never looked beyond her cheese.&nbsp; Old Gardon
would be an admirable adviser, and if he were taken into the <i>
menage</i> she would add to the endowment another arable field, and
grass for two more cows. If she liked the young woman on
inspection, the marriage should take place in her own august
presence.</p>

<p>What! had Maitre Gardon refused?&nbsp; Forbidden that the
subject should be mentioned to his daughter?&nbsp;
Impossible!&nbsp; Either Mace had managed matters foolishly, or the
old man had some doubt of him which she could remove, or else it
was foolish reluctance to part with his daughter-in-law.&nbsp; Or
the gossips were right after all, and he knew her to be too
light-minded, if not worse, to be the wife of any pious young
minister.&nbsp; Or there was some mystery.&nbsp; Any way, Madame la
Duchesse would see him, and bring him to his senses, make him give
the girl a good husband if she were worthy, or devote her to
condign punishment if she were unworthy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.&nbsp; MADAME LA DUCHESSE</h3>

<p>He found an ancient dame in dim brocade.---TENNYSON</p>

<p>Madame la Duchesse de Quinet had been a great heiress and a
personal friend and favourite of Queen Jeanne d'Albret.&nbsp; She
had been left a widow after five years' marriage, and for forty
subsequent years had reigned despotically in her own name and that
of <i>mon fils</i>.&nbsp; Busied with the support of the Huguenot
cause, sometimes by arms, but more usually by politics, and
constantly occupied by the hereditary government of one of the
lesser counties of France, the Duke was all the better son for
relinquishing to her the home administration, as well as the
education of his two motherless boys; and their confidence and
affection were perfect, though he was almost as seldom at home as
she was abroad.&nbsp; At times, indeed, she had visited Queen
Jeanne at Nerac; but since the good Queen's death, she only left
the great chateau of Quinet to make a royal progress of inspection
through the family towns, castles, and estates, sometimes to winter
in her beautiful hereditary <i>hotel</i> at Montauban, and as at
present to attend any great assembly of the Reformed.</p>

<p>Very seldom was her will not law.&nbsp; Strong sense and
judgment, backed by the learning that Queen Marguerite of Navarre
had introduced among the companions of her daughter, had rendered
her superior to most of those with whom she came in contact: and
the Huguenot ministers, who were much more dependent on their laity
than the Catholic priesthood, for the most part treated her as not
only a devout and honourable woman, an elect lady, but as a sort of
State authority.&nbsp; That she had the right-mindedness to respect
and esteem such men as Theodore Beza, Merlin, &amp;c., who treated
her with great regard, but never cringed, had not become known to
the rest.&nbsp; Let her have once pronounced against poor little
Esperance Gardon, and public disgrace would be a matter of
certainty.</p>

<p>There she sat in her wainscoted walnut cabinet, a small woman by
her inches, but stately enough to seem of majestic stature, and
with gray eyes, of inexpressible keenness, which she fixed upon the
halting, broken form of Isaac Gardon, and his grave, venerable
face, as she half rose and made a slight acknowledgment of his low
bow.</p>

<p>'Sit, Maitre Gardon, you are lame,' she said, with a wave of her
hand.&nbsp; 'I gave you the incommodity of coming to see me not
openly discuss <i>en pleine sale</i>.'</p>

<p>'Madame is considerate,' said Isaac, civilly, but with an
open-eyed look and air that at once showed her that she had not to
deal with one of the ministers who never forgot their low birth in
intercourse with her.</p>

<p>'I understand,' said she, coming to the point at once, 'that you
decline the proposals of Samuel Mace for your
daughter-in-law.&nbsp; Now I wish you to know that Mace is a very
good youth, whom I have known from his birth'--and she went on in
his praise, Isaac bowing at each pause, until she had exhausted
both Mace's history and her own beneficent intentions for
him.&nbsp; Then he said, 'Madame is very good, and the young man
appeared to me excellent.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this thing may not
be.&nbsp; My daughter-in-law has resolved not to marry again.'</p>

<p>'Nay, but this is mere folly,' said the Duchess.&nbsp; 'We hold
not Catholic tenets on merit in abstaining, but rather go by St.
Paul's advice that the younger widows should marry, rather than wax
wanton.&nbsp; And, to tell you the truth, Maitre Gardon, this
daughter of yours does seem to have set tongues in motion.'</p>

<p>'Not by her own fault, Madame.'</p>

<p>'Stay, my good friend; I never found a man--minister or lay--who
was a fair judge in these matters.&nbsp; You old men are no better
than the young--rather worse--because you do not distrust
yourselves.&nbsp; Now, I say no harm of the young woman, and I know
an angel would be abused at Montauban for not wearing sad-coloured
wings; but she needs a man's care--you are frail, you cannot live
for ever--and how is it to be with her and her child?'</p>

<p>'I hope to bestow them among her kindred ere I die, Madame,'
said Isaac.</p>

<p>'No kindred can serve a woman like a sensible husband!&nbsp;
Besides, I thought all perished at Paris.&nbsp; Listen, Isaac
Gardon: I tell you plainly that scandal is afloat.&nbsp; You are
blamed for culpable indifference to alleged levities--I say not
that it is true--but I see this, that unless you can bestow your
daughter-in-law on a good, honest man, able to silence the whispers
of malice, there will be measures taken that will do shame both to
your own gray hairs and to the memory of your dead son, as well as
expose the poor young woman herself.&nbsp; You are one who has a
true tongue, Isaac Gardon; and if you can assure me that she is a
faithful, good woman, as poor Mace thinks her, and will give her to
him in testimony thereof, then shall not a mouth open against
her.&nbsp; If not, in spite of all my esteem for you, the
discipline of the Reformed must take its course.'</p>

<p>'And for what?' said Isaac, with a grave tone, almost of
reproof.&nbsp; 'What discipline can punish a woman for letting her
infant wear a coloured ribbon, and shielding it from a blow?'</p>

<p>'That is not all, Master Isaac,' said the Duchess,
seriously.&nbsp; 'In spite of your much-respected name, evil and
censorious tongues will have it that matters ought to be
investigated; that there is some mystery; that the young woman does
not give a satisfactory account of herself, and that the child does
not resemble either her or your son--in short, that you may be
deceived by an impostor, perhaps a Catholic spy.&nbsp; Mind, I say
not that I credit all this, only I would show you what reports you
must guard against.'</p>

<p><i>'La pauvre petite</i>!' said Isaac, under his breath, as if
appalled; then collecting himself, he said, 'Madame, these are
well-nigh threats.&nbsp; I had come hither nearly resolved to
confined in you without them.'</p>

<p>'Then there is a mystery?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Madame, but the deception is solely in the name.&nbsp; She
is, in very truth, a widow of a martyr of the St. Barthelemy, but
that martyr was not my son, whose wife was happy in dying with
him.'</p>

<p>'And who, then, is she?'</p>

<p>'Madame la Duchesse had heard of the family of Ribaumont.'</p>

<p>'Ha! M. de Ribaumont!&nbsp; A gay comrade of King Henry II., but
who had his eyes opened to the truth by M. l'Amiral, though he
lacked courage for an open profession.&nbsp; Yes, the very last
pageant I beheld at court, was the wedding of his little son to the
Count de Ribaumont's daughter.&nbsp; It was said that the youth was
one of our victims at Paris.'</p>

<p>'Even so, Madame; and this poor child is the little one whom you
saw wedded to him.'&nbsp; And then, in answer to the Duchess's
astonished inquiry, he proceeded to relate how Eustacie had been
forced to fly from her kindred, and how he had first encountered
her at his own lurking-placed, and had accepted her as a charge
imposed on him by Providence; then explained how, at La Sablerie,
she had been recognized by a young gentleman whom she had known at
Paris, but who professed to be fleeing to England, there to study
the Protestant controversy; and how she had confided to him a
letter to her husband's mother, who was married in England, begging
her to send for her and her daughter, the latter being heiress to
certain English estates, as well as French.</p>

<p>'Madame,' added Gardon, 'Heaven forgive me, if I do the Youth
injustice by suspecting him, but no answer ever arrived to that
letter; and while we still expected one, a good and kindly citizen,
who I trust has long been received into glory, sent me notice that
a detachment of Monsieur's army was on its way from La Rochelle,
under command of M. de Nid de Merle, to search out this poor lady
in La Sablerie.&nbsp; He, good man, deemed that, were we gone, he
could make terms for the place, and we therefore quitted it.&nbsp;
Alas!&nbsp; Madame knows how it fared with the pious friend we
left.&nbsp; Little deeming how they would be dealt with, we took
our way along the Sables d'Olonne, where alone we could be safe,
since, as Madame knows, they are for miles impracticable for
troops.&nbsp; But we had another enemy there--the tide; and there
was a time when we truly deemed that the mercy granted us had been
that we had fallen into the hand of the Lord instead of the hand of
cruel man.&nbsp; Yes, Madame, and even for that did she give
thanks, as she stood, never even trembling, on the low sandbank,
with her babe in her bosom, and the sea creeping up on all
sides.&nbsp; She only turned to me with a smile, saying, 'She is
asleep, she will not feel it, or know anything till she wakes up in
Paradise, and sees her father.'&nbsp; Never saw I a woman, either
through nature or grace, so devoid of fear.&nbsp; We were rescued
at last, by the mercy of Heaven, which sent a fisherman, who bore
us to his boat when benumbed with cold, and scarce able to
move.&nbsp; He took us to a good priest's, Colombeau of Nissard, a
man who, as Madame may know, is one of those veritable saints who
still are sustained by the truth within their Church, and is full
of charity and mercy.&nbsp; He asked me no questions, but fed,
warmed, sheltered us, and sped us on our way.&nbsp; Perhaps,
however, I was over-confident in myself, as the guardian of the
poor child, for it was Heaven's will that the cold and wet of our
night on the sands--though those tender young frames did not suffer
therefrom--should bring on an illness which has made an old man of
me.&nbsp; I struggled on as long as I could, hoping to attain to a
safe resting-place for her, but the winter cold completed the work;
and then, Madame--oh that I could tell you the blessing she was to
me!--her patience, her watchfulness, her tenderness, through all
the long weeks that I lay helpless alike in mind and body at
Charente.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Madame, had my own daughter lived, she
could not have been more to me than that noble lady; and her
cheerful love did even more for me than her tender care.'</p>

<p>'I must see her,' ejaculated the Duchesse; then added, 'But was
it this illness that hindered you from placing her in safety in
England?'</p>

<p>'In part, Madame; nay, I may say, wholly.&nbsp; We learnt that
the assembly was to take place here, and I had my poor testimony to
deliver, and to give notice of my intention to my brethren before
going to a foreign land, whence perhaps I may never return.'</p>

<p>'She ought to be in England,' said Madame de Quinet; 'she will
never be safe from these kinsmen in this country.'</p>

<p>'M. de Nid de Merle has been all the spring in Poland with the
King,' said the minister, 'and the poor lady is thought to have
perished at La Sablerie.&nbsp; Thus the danger has been less
pressing, but I would have taken her to England at once, if I could
have made sure of her reception, and besides---' be faltered.</p>

<p>'The means?' demanded the Duchess, guessing at the meaning.</p>

<p>'Madame is right.&nbsp; She had brought away some money and
jewels with her, but alas, Madame, during my illness, without my
knowledge, the dear child absolutely sold them to procure comforts
for me.&nbsp; Nay'-- his eyes filled with tears--'she whom they
blame for vanities sold the very hair from her head to purchase
unguents to ease the old man's pains; nor did I know it for many a
day after.&nbsp; From day to day we can live, for our own people
willingly support a pastor and his family; and in every house my
daughter has been loved,-- everywhere but in this harsh-judging
town.&nbsp; But for the expense of a voyage, even were we at
Bordeaux or La Rochelle, we have nothing, save by parting with the
only jewels that remain to her, and those--those, she says, are
heirlooms; and, poor child, she guards them almost as jealously as
her infant, around whom she has fastened them beneath her
clothes.&nbsp; She will not even as yet hear of leaving them in
pledge, to be redeemed by the family.&nbsp; She says they would
hardly know her without them.&nbsp; And truly, Madame, I scarce
venture to take her to England, ere I know what reception would
await her.&nbsp; Should her husband's family disown or cast her
off, I could take better care of her here than in a strange
land.'</p>

<p>'You are right, Maitre Gardon,' said the Duchess; 'the risk
might be great.&nbsp; I would see this lady.&nbsp; She must be a
rare creature.&nbsp; Bear her my greetings, my friend, and pray her
to do me the honour of a visit this afternoon.&nbsp; Tell her I
would come myself to her, but that I understand she does not wish
to attract notice.'</p>

<p>'Madame,' said Isaac, rising, and with a strange manner, between
a smile and a tear of earnestness, 'allow me to bespeak your
goodness for my daughter.&nbsp; The poor little thing is scarcely
more than a child.&nbsp; She is but eighteen even now, and it is
not always easy to tell whether she will be an angel of noble
goodness, or, pardon me, a half-petulant child.'</p>

<p>'I understand:' Madame de Quinet laughed, and she probably did
understand more than reluctant, anxious Isaac Gardon thought she
did, of his winning, gracious, yet haughty, head-strong little
charge, so humbly helpful one moment, so self-asserting and
childish the next, so dear to him, yet so unlike anything in his
experience.</p>

<p>'Child,' he said, as he found her in the sunny window engaged in
plaiting the deep folds of his starched ruffs, 'you have something
to forgive me.'</p>

<p>'Fathers do not ask their children's pardon,' said Eustacie,
brightly, but then, with sudden dismay, 'Ah! you have not said I
should go to the Moustier again.'</p>

<p>'No, daughter; but Madame de Quinet entreats--these are her
words-- that you will do her the honour of calling on her.&nbsp;
She would come to you, but that she fears to attract notice to
us.'</p>

<p>'You have told her!' exclaimed Eustacie.</p>

<p>'I was compelled, but I had already thought of asking your
consent, and she is a true and generous lady, with whom your secret
will be safe, and who can hush the idle tongues here.&nbsp; So,
daughter,' he added restlessly, 'don your hood; that ruff will
serve for another day.'</p>

<p>'Another day, when the morrow is Sunday, and my father's ruff is
to put to shame all the other pastors',' said Eustacie, her quick
fingers still moving.&nbsp; 'No, he shall not go ill-starched for
any Duchess in France.&nbsp; Now am I in any haste to be lectured
by Madame de Quinet, as they say she lectured the Dame de Soubrera
the other day.'</p>

<p>'My child, you will go; much depends on it.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, I am going; only if Madame de Quinet knows who I am,
she will not expect me to hurry at her beck and call the first
moment.&nbsp; Here, Rayonette, my bird, my beauty, thou must have a
clean cap; ay, and these flaxen curls combed.'</p>

<p>'Would you take the child?'</p>

<p>'Would I go without Mademoiselle de Rambouillet?&nbsp; She is
all her mother is, and more.&nbsp; There, now she is a true
rose-bud, ready to perch on my arm.&nbsp; No, no <i>bon
pere</i>.&nbsp; So great a girl is too much for you to carry.&nbsp;
Don't be afraid, my darling, we are not going to a sermon, no one
will beat her; oh no, and if the insolent retainers and pert
lacqueys laugh at her mother, no one will hurt her.'</p>

<p>'Nay, child,' said Maitre Gardon; 'this is a well-ordered
household, where contempt and scorn are not suffered.&nbsp; Only,
dear, dear daughter, let me pray you to be your true self with the
Duchess.'</p>

<p>Eustacie shrugged her shoulders, and had mischief enough in her
to enjoy keeping her good father in some doubt and dread as he went
halting wearily by her side along the much-decorated streets that
marked the grand Gasche of Tarn and Tarascon.&nbsp; The Hotel de
Quinet stretched out its broad stone steps, covered with vaultings,
absolutely across the street, affording a welcome shade, and no
obstruction where wheeled carriages never came.</p>

<p>All was, as Maitre Isaac had said, decorum itself. A couple of
armed retainers, rigid as sentinels, waited on the steps; a grave
porter, maimed in the wars opened the great door; half a
dozen&nbsp; <i>laquais</i> in sober though rich liveries sat on a
bench in the hall, and had somewhat the air of having been set to
con a lesson.&nbsp; Two of them coming respectfully forward,
ushered Maitre Gardon and his companion to an ante-room, where
various gentlemen, or pastors, or candidates--among them Samuel
Mace--were awaiting a summons to the Duchess, or merely using it as
a place of assembly.&nbsp; A page of high birth, but well schooled
in steadiness of demeanour, went at once to announce the arrival;
and Gardon and his companion had not been many moments in
conversation with their acquaintance among the ministers, before
the grave gentleman returned, apparently from his audience and the
page, coming to Eustacie, intimated that she was to follow him to
Madame le Duchesse's presence.</p>

<p>He conducted her across a great tapestry-hung saloon, where
twelve or fourteen ladies of all ages--from seventy to fifteen--sat
at work: some at tapestry, some spinning, some making coarse
garments for the poor.&nbsp; A great throne-like chair, with a
canopy over it, a footstool, a desk and a small table before it,
was vacant, and the work--a poor child's knitted cap--laid down;
but an elderly minister, seated at a carved desk, had not
discontinued reading from a great black book, and did not even
cease while the strangers crossed the room, merely making a slight
inclination with his head, while the ladies half rose, rustled a
slight reverence with their black, gray or russet skirts, but
hardly lifted their eyes.&nbsp; Eustacie thought the Louvre had
never been half so formidable or impressive.</p>

<p>The page lifted a heavy green curtain behind the canopy, knocked
at a door, and, as it opened, Eustacie was conscious of a dignified
presence, that, in spite of her previous petulance, caused her
instinctively to bend in such a reverence as had formerly been
natural to her; but, at the same moment, a low and magnificent
curtsey was made to her, a hand was held out, a stately kiss was on
her brow, and a voice of dignified courtesy said, 'Pardon me,
Madame la Baronne, for giving you this trouble.&nbsp; I feared that
otherwise we could not safely meet.'</p>

<p>'Madame is very good.&nbsp; My Rayonette, make thy reverence;
kiss thy hand to the lady, my lamb.'&nbsp; And the little one
obeyed, gazing with her blue eyes full opened, and clinging to her
mother.</p>

<p>'Ah!&nbsp; Madame la Baronne makes herself obeyed,' said Madame
de Quinet, well pleased.&nbsp; 'Is it then a girl?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Madame, I could scarcely forgive her at first; but she has
made herself all the dearer to me.'</p>

<p>'It is a pity,' said Madame de Quinet, 'for yours is an ancient
stem.'</p>

<p>'Did Madame know my parents?' asked Eustacie, drawn from her
spirit of defiance by the equality of the manner with which she was
treated.</p>

<p>'Scarcely,' replied the Duchess; but, with a smile, 'I had the
honour to see you married.'</p>

<p>'Ah, then,'--Eustacie glowed, almost smiled, though a tear was
in her eyes--'you can see how like my little one is to her
father,--a true White Ribaumont.'</p>

<p>The Duchess had not the most distinct recollection of the
complexion of the little bridegroom; but Rayonette's fairness was
incontestable, and the old lady complimented it so as to draw on
the young mother into confidence on the pet moonbeam appellation
which she used in dread of exciting suspicion by using the true
name of Berangere, with all the why and wherefore.</p>

<p>It was what the Duchess wanted. Imperious as some thought her,
she would on no account have appeared to cross-examine any one
whose essential nobleness of nature struck her as did little
Eustacie's at the first moment she saw her; and yet she had
decided, before the young woman arrived, that her own good opinion
and assistance should depend on the correspondence of Madame de
Ribaumont's history of herself with Maitre Gardon's.</p>

<p>Eustacie had, for a year and a half, lived with peasants; and,
indeed, since the trials of her life had really begun, she had
never been with a woman of her own station to whom she could give
confidence, or from whom she could look for sympathy.&nbsp; And
thus a very few inquiries and tokens of interest from the old lady
drew out the whole story, and more than once filled Madame de
Quinet's eyes with tears.</p>

<p>There was only one discrepancy; Eustacie could not believe that
the Abbe de Mericour had been a faithless messenger.&nbsp; Oh,
no!&nbsp; either those savage-looking sailors had played him false,
or else her <i>bele-mere</i> would not send for her.&nbsp; 'My
mother-in-law never loved me,' said Eustacie; 'I know she never
did.&nbsp; And now she has children by her second marriage, and no
doubt would not see my little one preferred to them.&nbsp; I will
not be HER suppliant.'</p>

<p>'And what then would you do?' said Madame de Quinet, with a more
severe tone.</p>

<p>'Never leave my dear father,' said Eustacie, with a flash of
eagerness; 'Maitre Isaac I mean.&nbsp; He has been more to me than
any--any one I ever knew--save----'</p>

<p>'You have much cause for gratitude to him,' said Madame de
Quinet.&nbsp; 'I honour your filial love to him.&nbsp; Yet, you
have duties to this little one.&nbsp; You have no right to keep her
from her position.&nbsp; You ought to write to England again.&nbsp;
I am sure Maitre Isaac tells you so.'</p>

<p>Eustacie would have pouted, but the grave, kind authority of the
manner prevented her from being childish, and she said, 'If I
wrote, it should be to my husband's grandfather, who brought him
up, designated him as his heir, and whom he loved with all his
heart.&nbsp; But, oh, Madame, he has one of those English
names!&nbsp; So dreadful!&nbsp; It sounds like Vol-au-vent, but it
is not that precisely.'</p>

<p>Madame de Quinet smiled, but she was a woman of resources.&nbsp;
'See, my friend,' she said, 'the pursuivant of the consuls here has
the rolls of the herald's visitations throughout the
kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The arms and name of the Baron de Ribaumont's
wife will there be entered; and from my house at Quinet you shall
write, and I, too, will write; my son shall take care that the
letters be forwarded safely, and you shall await their arrival
under my protection.&nbsp; That will be more fitting than running
the country with an old pastor, <i>hein</i>?'</p>

<p>'Madame, nothing shall induce me to quit him!' exclaimed
Eustacie, vehemently.</p>

<p>'Hear me out, child,' said the Duchess.&nbsp; 'He goes with us
to assist my chaplain; he is not much fitter for wandering than
you, or less so.&nbsp; And you, Madame, must, I fear me, still
remain his daughter-in-law in my household; or if you bore your own
name and rank, this uncle and cousin of yours might learn that you
were still living; and did they claim you---'</p>

<p>'Oh, Madame, rather let me be your meanest kitchen-girl!'</p>

<p>'To be--what do they call you?--Esperance Gardon will be quite
enough.&nbsp; I have various women here--widows, wives, daughters
or sufferers for the truth's sake, who either are glad of rest, or
are trained up to lead a godly life in the discipline of my
household. &nbsp;Among them you can live without suspicion,
provided,' the old lady added, smiling, 'you can abstain from
turning the heads of our poor young candidates.'</p>

<p>'Madame,' said Eustacie, gravely, 'I shall never turn any one's
head.&nbsp; There was only one who was obliged to love me, and
happily I am nor fair enough to win any one else.'</p>

<p>'<i>Tenez</i>, child.&nbsp; Is this true simplicity?&nbsp; Did
Gardon, truly, never tell you of poor Samuel Mace?'</p>

<p>Eustacie's face expressed such genuine amazement and
consternation, that the Duchess could not help touching her on the
cheek, and saying, 'Ah! simple as a <i>pensionnaire</i>, as we used
to say when no one else was innocent.&nbsp; But it is true, my
dear, that to poor Samuel we owe our meeting.&nbsp; I will send him
off, the poor fellow, at once to Bourge-le-Roy to preach his three
sermons; and when they had driven you a little out of his head, he
shall have Mariette there--a good girl, who will make him an
excellent wife.&nbsp; She is ugly enough, but it will be all the
same to him just then!&nbsp; I will see him, and let him know that
I have reasons. He lodges in your house, does he?&nbsp; Then you
had better come to see me at once.&nbsp; So will evil tongues best
be silenced.</p>

<p>'But hold,' the Duchess said, smiling.&nbsp; 'You will think me
a foolish old woman, but is it true that you have saved the Pearls
of Ribaumont, of which good Canon Froissart tells?'</p>

<p>Eustacie lifted her child on her knee, untied the little gray
frock, and showed them fastened beneath, well out of sight.&nbsp;
'I thought my treasures should guard one another,' she said.&nbsp;
'One I sent as a token to my mother-in-law. For the rest, they are
not mine, but hers; her father lent them to me, not gave: so she
wears them thus; and anything but HER life should go rather than
THEY should.'</p>

<p>'<i>Hein</i>, a fine guardian for them!' was all the Duchess
said in answer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXV.&nbsp; THE ITALIAN PEDLAR</h3>

<p>This caitiff monk for gold did swear,</p>

<p>That by his drugs my rival fair</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A saint in heaven should be.--SCOTT</p>

<p>A grand cavalcade bore the house of Quinet from
Montauban--coaches, wagons, outriders, gendarmes--it was a perfect
court progress, and so low and cumbrous that it was a whole week in
reaching a grand old castle standing on a hill-side among chestnut
woods, with an avenue a mile long leading up to it; and
battlemented towers fit to stand a siege.</p>

<p>Eustacie was ranked among the Duchess's gentlewomen.&nbsp; She
was so far acknowledged as a lady of birth, that she was usually
called Madame Esperance; and though no one was supposed to doubt
her being Theodore Gardon's widow, she was regarded as being a
person of rank who had made a misalliance by marrying him.&nbsp;
This Madame de Quinet had allowed the household to infer, thinking
that the whole bearing of her guest was too unlike that of a Paris
<i>bourgeoise</i> not to excite suspicion, but she deemed it wiser
to refrain from treating her with either intimacy or distinction
that might excite jealousy or suspicion.&nbsp; Even as it was, the
consciousness of a secret, or the remnants of Montauban gossip,
prevented any familiarity between Eustacie and the good ladies who
surrounded her; they were very civil to each other, but their only
connecting link was the delight that every one took in petting
pretty little Rayonette, and the wonder that was made of her signs
of intelligence and attempts at talking.&nbsp; Even when she
toddled fearlessly up to the stately Duchess on her canopied
throne, and held out her entreating hands, and lisped the word <i>
'nontre</i>,' Madame would pause in her avocations, take her on her
knee, and display that wonderful gold and enamel creature which
cried tic-tic, and still remained an unapproachable mystery to M.
le Marquis and M. le Vicomte, her grandsons.</p>

<p>Pale, formal stiff boys they looked, twelve and ten years old,
and under the dominion of a very learned tutor, who taught them
Latin, Greek and Hebrew, alternately with an equally precise, stiff
old esquire, who trained them in martial exercises, which seemed to
be as much matters of rote with them as their tasks, and to be
quite as uninteresting.&nbsp; It did not seem as if they ever
played, or thought of playing; and if they were ever to be gay,
witty Frenchmen, a wonderful change must come over them.</p>

<p>The elder was already betrothed to a Bearnese damsel, of an
unimpeachably ancient and Calvinistic family; and the whole
establishment had for the last three years been employed on
tapestry hangings for a whole suite of rooms, that were to be
fitted up and hung with the histories of Ruth, of Abigail, of the
Shunammite, and of Esther, which their diligent needles might hope
to complete by the time the marriage should take place, three years
later!&nbsp; The Duchess, who really was not unlike 'that great
woman' the Shunammite, in her dignified content with 'dwelling
among her own people,' and her desire to 'receive a prophet in the
name of a prophet,' generally sat presiding over the work while
some one, chaplain, grandson, or young maiden, read aloud from
carefully assorted books; religious treatises at certain hours, and
at others, history. Often, however, Madame was called away into her
cabinet, where she gave audience to intendants, notaries from her
estates, pastors from the villages, captains of little garrisons,
soldiers offering service, farmers, women, shepherds, foresters,
peasants, who came either on her business or with their own needs--
for all of which she was ready with the beneficence and decision of
an autocrat.</p>

<p>The chapel had been 'purified,' and made bare of all altar or
image.&nbsp; It was filled with benches and a desk, whence Isaac
Gardon, the chaplain, any pastor on a visit, or sometimes a
candidate for his promotion, would expound, and offer prayers,
shortly in the week, more at length on Sunday; and there, too,
classes were held for the instruction of the peasants.</p>

<p>There was a great garden full of medicinal plants, and
decoctions and distilleries were the chief variety enjoyed by the
gentlewomen.&nbsp; The Duchess had studied much in quaint Latin and
French medical books, and, having great experience and good sense,
was probably as good a doctor as any one in the kingdom except
Ambroise Pare and his pupils; and she required her ladies to
practise under her upon the numerous ailments that the peasants
were continually bringing for her treatment.&nbsp; 'No one could
tell,' she said, 'how soon they might be dealing with gun-shot
wounds, and all ought to know how to sew up a gash, or cure an
argue.'</p>

<p>This department suited Eustacie much better than the stitching,
and best of all she liked to be sent with Maitre Isaac to some
cottage where solace for soul and body were needed, and the inmate
was too ill to be brought to Madame la Duchess.&nbsp; She was
learning much and improving too in the orderly household, but her
wanderings had made her something of a little gipsy.&nbsp; She now
and then was intolerably weary, and felt as if she had been
entirely spoilt for her natural post.&nbsp; 'What would become of
her,' she said to Maitre Isaac, 'if she were too grand to dress
Rayonette?'</p>

<p>She was not greatly distressed that the Montauban pursuivant
turned out to have only the records of the Provencal nobility, and
was forced to communicate with his brethren at Bordeaux before he
could bring down the Ribaumont genealogy to the actual generation;
and so slow was communication, so tardy the mode of doing
everything, that the chestnut leaves were falling and autumn
becoming winter before the blazoned letter showed Ribaumont, de
Picardie--'Gules, fretty or, a canton of the last, a leopard,
sable.&nbsp; Eustacie Berangere, m.&nbsp; Annora, daughter and
heiress of Villiam, Baron of Valvem, in the county of Dorisette,
England, who beareth, azure, a siren regardant in a mirror
proper.'&nbsp; The siren was drawn in all her propriety impaled
with the leopard, and she was so much more comprehensible than the
names, to both Madame de Quinet and Eustacie, that it was a pity
they could not direct their letters to her rather than to 'Le Baron
de Valvem,' whose cruel W's perplexed them so much.&nbsp; However,
the address was the least of Eustacie's troubles; she should be
only too glad when she got to that, and she was sitting in Maitre
Isaac's room, trying to make him dictate her sentences and asking
him how to spell every third word, when the dinner-bell rang, and
the whole household dropped down from <i>salon</i>, library, study,
or chamber to the huge hall, with its pavement of black and white
marble, and its long tables, for Madame de Quinet was no woman to
discard wholesome old practices.</p>

<p>Then, as Eustacie, with Rayonette trotting at her side, and
Maitre Isaac leaning on her arm, slowly made her way to that high
table where dined Madame la Duchess, her grandsons, the ministers,
the gentlemen in waiting, and some three or four women besides
herself, she saw that the lower end of the great hall was full of
silks, cloths, and ribbons heaped together; and, passing by the
lengthy rank of retainers, she received a bow and look of
recognition from a dark, acute-looking visage which she remembered
to belong to the pedlar she had met at Charente.</p>

<p>The Duchess, at the head of her table, was not in the best of
humours.&nbsp; Her son had sent home letters by a courier whom he
had picked up for himself and she never liked nor trusted, and he
required an immediate reply when she particularly resented being
hurried.&nbsp; It was a <i>galimafre</i>, literally a hash, she
said; for indeed most matters where she was not consulted did
become a <i>galimafre</i> with her.&nbsp; Moreover, under favour of
the courier, her porters had admitted this pedlar, and the Duchess
greatly disliked pedlars.&nbsp; All her household stores were
bought at shops of good repute in Montauban, and no one ought to be
so improvident as to require dealings with these mountebank
vagabonds, who dangled vanities before the eyes of silly girls, and
filled their heads with Paris fashion, if they did not do still
worse, and excite them to the purchase of cosmetics and
love-charms.</p>

<p>Yet the excitement caused by the approach of a pedlar was
invincible, even by Madame la Duchess. It was inevitable that the
crying need of glove, kerchief, needle, or the like, should be
discovered as soon as he came within ken, and, once in the hall,
there was no being rid of him except by a flagrant act of
inhospitality.&nbsp; This time it was worst of all, for M. le
Marquis himself must needs be the first to spy him, bring him in,
and be in want of a silver chain for his hawk; and his brother the
Vicomte must follow him up with all manner of wants inspired by the
mere sight of the pack.</p>

<p>Every one with the smallest sum of money must buy, every one
without inspect and assist in bargaining; and all dinner-time,
eyes, thoughts, and words were wandering to the gay pile in the
corner, or reckoning up needs and means.&nbsp; The pedlar, too,
knew what a Calvinist household was, and had been extremely
discreet, producing nothing that could reasonably be objected to;
and the Duchess, seeing that the stream was too strong for her,
wisely tried to steer her bark through it safely instead of
directly opposing it.</p>

<p>As soon as grace was over, she called her maitre d'hotel, and
bade him look after that <i>galimafre</i>, and see that none of
these fools were unreasonably cheated, and that there was no
attempt at gulling the young ones with charms or fortune-telling,
as well as to conclude the matter so as to give no excuse for the
Italian fellow lingering to sup and sleep.&nbsp; She then retired
to her cabinet to prepare her dispatches, which were to include a
letter to Lord Walwyn.&nbsp; Though a nominal friendship subsisted
between Elisabeth and the French court, the Huguenot chiefs always
maintained a correspondence with England, and there was little
danger but that the Duke de Quinet would be able to get a letter,
sooner or later, conveyed to any man of mark.&nbsp; In the course
of her letter, Madame de Quinet found it necessary to refer to
Eustacie.&nbsp; She rang her little silver handbell for the
hall.&nbsp; There, of course, Master Page had been engulfed in the
<i>galimafre</i>, and not only forming one of the swarm around the
pedlar, but was actually aping courtly grimaces as he tried a
delicate lace ruffle on the hand of a silly little smirking maiden,
no older than himself!&nbsp; But this little episode was, like many
others, overlooked by Madame de Quinet, as her eye fell upon the
little figure of Rayonette standing on the table, with her mother
and two or three ladies besides coaxing her to open her mouth, and
show the swollen gums that had of late been troubling her, while
the pedlar was evidently expending his blandishments upon her.</p>

<p>The maitre d'hotel was the first to perceive his mistress, and,
as he approached, received a sharp rebuke from her for allowing the
fellow to produce his quack medicines; and, at the same time, she
desired him to request Madame Esperance to come to her immediately
on business.&nbsp; Eustacie, who always had a certain self-willed
sense of opposition when the Duchess showed herself peremptory
towards her, at first began to make answer that she would come as
soon as her business was concluded; but the steward made a gesture
towards the great lady sailing up and down as she paced the <i>
dais</i> in stately impatience.&nbsp; 'Good fellow,' she said, 'I
will return quickly, and see you again, though I am now
interrupted.&nbsp; Stay there, little one, with good Mademoiselle
Perrot; mother will soon be back.'</p>

<p>Rayonette, in her tooth-fretfulnes, was far from enduring to be
forsaken so near a strange man, and her cry made it necessary for
Eustacie to take her in arms, and carry her to the <i>dais</i>
where the Duchess was waiting.</p>

<p>'So!' said the lady, 'I suspected that the fellow was a quack as
well as a cheat.'</p>

<p>'Madame,' said Eustacie, with spirit, 'he sold me unguents that
greatly relieved my father last spring.'</p>

<p>'And because rubbing relieved an old man's rheumatics, you would
let a vagabond cheat drug and sicken this poor child for what is
not ailment at all--and the teeth will relieve in a few days.&nbsp;
Or, if she were feverish, have not we decoctions brewed from
Heaven's own pure herbs in the garden, with no unknown
ingredient?'</p>

<p>'Madame,' said Eustacie, ruffling into fierceness, 'you are very
good to me; but I must keep the management of my daughter to
myself.'</p>

<p>The Duchess looked at her from head to foot.&nbsp; Perhaps it
was with an impulse to treat her impertinence as she would have
done that of a dependant; but the old lady never forgot herself:
she only shrugged her shoulders and said, with studied politeness,
'When I unfortunately interrupted your consultation with this
eminent physician, it was to ask you a question regarding this
English family.&nbsp; Will you do me the honour to enter my
cabinet?'</p>

<p>And whereas no one was looking, the old lady showed her
displeasure by ushering Madame de Ribaumont into her cabinet like a
true noble stranger guest; so that Eustacie felt disconcerted.</p>

<p>The Duchess then began to read aloud her own letter to Lord
Walwyn, pausing at every clause, so that Eustacie felt the delay
and discussion growing interminable, and the Duchess then requested
to have Madame de Ribaumont's own letter at once, as she wished to
inclose it, make up her packet, and send it without delay.&nbsp;
Opening a secret door in her cabinet, she showed Eustacie stair by
which she might reach Maitre Gardon's room without crossing the
hall.&nbsp; Eustacie hoped to find him there and tell him how
intolerable was the Duchess; but, though she found him, it was in
company with the tutor, who was spending an afternoon on Plato with
him.&nbsp; She could only take up her letter and retreat to
Madame's cabinet, where she had left her child.&nbsp; She finished
it as best she might, addressed it after the herald's spelling of
the title, bound it with some of the Duchess's black floss
silk--wondering meanwhile, but little guessing that the pedlar
knew, where was the tress that had bound her last attempt at
correspondence, guessing least of all that that tress lay on a
heart still living and throbbing for her.&nbsp; All this had made
her a little forget her haste to assert her liberty of action by
returning to the pedlar; but, behold, when she came back to the
hall, it had resumed its pristine soberness, and merely a few
lingering figures were to be seen, packing up their purchases.</p>

<p>While she was still looking round in dismay, Mademoiselle Perrot
came up to her and said, 'Ah!&nbsp; Madame, you may well
wonder!&nbsp; I never saw Maitre Benoit there so cross; the poor
man did but offer to sell little Fanchon the elixir that secures a
good husband, and old Benoit descended on him like a griffin
enraged, would scarce give him time to compute his charges or pack
his wares, but hustled him forth like a mere thief!&nbsp; And I
missed my bargain for that muffler that had so taken my
fancy.&nbsp; But, Madame, he spoke to me apart, and said you were
an old customer of his, and that rather than the little angel
should suffer with her teeth, which surely threaten convulsions, he
would leave with you this sovereign remedy of sweet syrup--a
spoonful to be given each night.'</p>

<p>Eustacie took the little flask.&nbsp; She was much inclined to
give the syrup by way of precaution, as well as to assure herself
that she was not under the Duchess's dominion; but some strong
instinct of the truth of the lady's words that the child was safer
and healthier undoctored, made her resolve at least to defer it
until the little one showed any perilous symptom.&nbsp; And as
happily Rayonette only showed two little white teeth, and much
greater good-humour, the syrup was nearly forgotten, when, a
fortnight after, the Duchess received a dispatch from her son which
filled her with the utmost indignation.&nbsp; The courier had
indeed arrived, but the packet had proved to be filled with hay and
waste-paper.&nbsp; And upon close examination, under the lash, the
courier had been forced to confess to having allowed himself to be
overtaken by the pedlar, and treated by him to a supper at a <i>
cabaret</i>.&nbsp; No doubt, while he was afterwards asleep, the
contents of his packet had been abstracted.&nbsp; There had been
important documents for the Duke besides Eustacie's letters, and
the affair greatly annoyed the Duchess, though she had the
compensation of having been proved perfectly right in her prejudice
against pedlars, and her dislike of her son's courier.&nbsp; She
sent for Eustacie to tell her privately of the loss, and of course
the young mother at once turned pale and exclaimed, 'The wicked
one!&nbsp; Ah! what a blessing that I gave my little darling none
of his dose!'</p>

<p>'<i>Hein</i>?&nbsp; You had some from him then!' demanded the
Duchess with displeasure.</p>

<p>'No, Madame, thanks, thanks to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! I never will
be self-willed and naughty again.&nbsp; Forgive me, Madame.'&nbsp;
And down she dropped on her knee, with clasped hands and glistening
eyes.</p>

<p>'Forgive you, silly child, for what?' said Madame de Quinet,
nearly laughing.</p>

<p>'Ah! for the angry, passionate thoughts I had! Ah! Madame, I was
all but giving the stuff to my little angel in very spite--and
then---'&nbsp; Eustacie's voice was drowned in passion of tears,
and she devoured the old lady's hand with her kisses.</p>

<p>'Come, come,' said the Duchess, 'let us be reasonable. A man may
be a thief, but it does not follow that he is a poisoner.'</p>

<p>'Nay, that will we see,' cried Eustacie.&nbsp; 'He was resolved
that the little lamb should not escape, and he left a flask for her
with Mademoiselle Perrot.&nbsp; I will fetch it, if Madame will
give me leave.&nbsp; Oh, the great mercy of Heaven that made her so
well that I gave her none!'</p>

<p>Madame de Quinet's analytic powers did not go very far; and
would probably have decided against the syrup if it had been
nothing but virgin honey.&nbsp; She was one who fully believed that
her dear Queen Jeanne had been poisoned with a pair of gloves, and
she had unlimited faith in the powers of evil possessed by Rene of
Milan.&nbsp; Of course, she detected the presence of a slow poison,
whose effects would have been attributed to the ailment it was
meant to cure; and though her evidence was insufficient, she
probably did Ercole no injustice.&nbsp; She declined testing the
compound on any unfortunate dog or cat, but sealed it up in the
presence of Gardon, Eustacie, and Mademoiselle Perrot, to be
produced against the pedlar if ever he should be caught.</p>

<p>Then she asked Eustacie if there was any reason to suspect that
he recognized her.&nbsp; Eustacie related the former dealings with
him, when she had sold him her jewels and her hair, but she had no
notion of his being the same person whom she had seen when at
Montpipeau.&nbsp; Indeed, he had altered his appearance so much
that he had been only discovered at Nid-de-Merle by eyes sharpened
by distrust of his pretensions to magic arts.</p>

<p>Madame de Quinet, however, concluded that Eustacie had been
known, or else that her jewels had betrayed her, and that the man
must have been employed by her enemies.&nbsp; If it had not been
the depth of winter, she would have provided for the persecuted
lady's immediate transmission to England; but he storms of the Bay
of Biscay would have made this impossible in the state of French
navigation, even if Isaac Gardon had been in a condition to move;
for the first return of cold had brought back severe rheumatic
pains, and with them came a shortness of breath which even the
Duchess did not know to be the token of heart complaint.&nbsp; He
was confined to his room, and it was kneeling by his bedside that
Eustacie poured out her thankfulness for her child's preservation,
and her own repentance for the passing fit of self-will and
petulance.&nbsp; The thought of Rayonette's safety seemed
absolutely to extinguish the fresh anxiety that had arisen since it
had become evident that her enemies no longer supposed her dead,
but were probably upon her traces.&nbsp; Somehow, danger had become
almost a natural element to her, and having once expressed her firm
resolution that nothing should separate her from her adopted
father, to whom indeed her care became constantly more necessary,
she seemed to occupy herself very little with the matter; she
nursed him as merrily as ever, and left to him and Madame de Quinet
the grave consultations as to what was to be done for her
security.&nbsp; There was a sort of natural buoyancy about her that
never realized a danger till it came, and then her spirit was
roused to meet it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI.&nbsp; SPELL AND POTION</h3>

<p>Churl, upon thy eyes I throw</p>

<p>All the power this charm doth owe</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM</p>

<p>Her rival lived!&nbsp; The tidings could not but be communicated
to Diane de Selinville, when her father set out <i>en grande
tenue</i> to demand his niece from the Duke de Quinet.&nbsp; This,
however, was not till spring was advancing; for the pedlar had not
been able to take a direct route back to Nid-de-Merle, since his
first measure had necessarily been to escape into a province where
the abstraction of a Huguenot nobleman's despatches would be
considered as a meritorious action.&nbsp; Winter weather, and the
practice of his profession likewise, delayed Ercole so much that it
was nearly Easter before he brought his certain intelligence to the
Chevalier, and to the lady an elixir of love, clear and coloured as
crystal, and infallible as an inspirer of affection.</p>

<p>Should she administer it, now that she knew her cousin not to be
the lawful object of affection she had so long esteemed him, but,
as he persisted in considering himself, a married man?&nbsp; Diane
had more scruples than she would have had a year before, for she
had not so long watched and loved one so true and conscientious as
Berenger de Ribaumont without having her perceptions elevated; but
at the same time the passion of love had become intensified, both
by long continuance and by resistance.&nbsp; She had attached
herself, believing him free, and her affections could not be
disentangled by learning that he was bound--rather the
contrary.</p>

<p>Besides, there was plenty of sophistry.&nbsp; Her father had
always assured her of the invalidity of the marriage, without
thinking it necessary to dwell on his own arrangements for making
it invalid, so that was no reasonable ground of objection; and a
lady of Diane's period, living in the world where she had lived,
would have had no notion of objecting to her lover for a previous
amour, and as such was she bidden to rank Berenger's relations with
Eustacie.&nbsp; And there was the less scruple on Eustacie's
account, because the Chevalier, knowing that the Duchess had a son
and two grandsons, had conceived a great terror that she meant to
give his niece to one of them; and this would be infinitely worse,
both for the interests of the family and of their party, than even
her reunion with the young Baron.&nbsp; Even Narcisse, who on his
return had written to Paris a grudging consent to the experiment of
his father and sister, had allowed that the preservation of
Berenger's life was needful till Eustacie should be in their power
so as to prevent such a marriage as that!&nbsp; To Diane, the very
suggestion became certainty: she already saw Eustacie's shallow
little heart consoled and her vanity excited by these magnificent
prospects, and she looked forward to the triumph of her own
constancy, when Berenger should find the image so long enshrined in
his heart crumble in its sacred niche.</p>

<p>Yet a little while then would she be patient, even though nearly
a year had passed and still she saw no effect upon her prisoners,
unless, indeed, Philip had drunk of one of her potions by mistake
and his clumsy admiration was the consequence.&nbsp; The two youths
went on exactly in the same manner, without a complaint, without a
request, occupying themselves as best they might--Berenger
courteously attentive recovered his health, and the athletic powers
displayed by the two brothers when wrestling, fencing, or
snow-balling in the courtyard, were the amazement and envy of their
guard. Twice in the course of the winter there had been an alarm of
wolves, and in their eagerness and excitement about this new sport,
they had accepted the Chevalier's offer of taking their parole for
the hunt.&nbsp; They had then gone forth with a huge posse of
villagers, who beat the woods with their dogs till the beast was
aroused from its lair and driven into the alleys, where waited
gentlemen, gendarmes, and game keepers with their guns.&nbsp; These
two chases were chiefly memorable to Berenger, because in the
universal intermingling of shouting peasants he was able in the
first to have some conversation with Eustacie's faithful protector
Martin, who told him the incidents of her wanderings, with tears in
his eyes, and blessed him for his faith that she was not dead; and
in the second, he actually found himself in the ravine of the
Grange du Temple.&nbsp; No need to ask, every voice was shouting
the name, and though the gendarmes were round him and he durst not
speak to Rotrou, still he could reply with significative
earnestness to the low bow with which the farmer bent to evident
certainty that here was the imprisoned Protestant husband of the
poor lady.&nbsp; Berenger wore his black vizard mask as had been
required of him, but the man's eyes followed him, as though
learning by heart the outline of his tall figure.&nbsp; The object
of the Chevalier's journey was, of course, a secret from the
prisoners, who merely felt its effects by having their meals served
to them in their own tower; and when he returned after about a
month's absence though him looking harassed, aged, and so much out
of humour that he could scarcely preserve his usual
politeness.&nbsp; In effect he was greatly chagrined.</p>

<p>'That she is in their hands is certain, the hypocrites!' he said
to his daughter and sister; 'and no less so that they have designs
on her; but I let them know that these could be easily
traversed.'</p>

<p>'But where is she, the unhappy apostate child?' said the
Abbess.&nbsp; 'They durst not refuse her to you.'</p>

<p>'I tell you they denied all present knowledge of her.&nbsp; The
Duke himself had the face to make as though he never heard of
her.&nbsp; He had no concern with his mother's household and guests
forsooth!&nbsp; I do not believe he has; the poor fellow stands in
awe of that terrible old heretic dragon, and keeps aloof from her
as much as he can.&nbsp; But he is, after all, a <i>beau jeune
home</i>; nor should I be surprised if he were the girl's gay
bridegroom by this time, though I gave him a hint that there was an
entanglement about the child's first marriage which, by French law,
would invalidate any other without a dispensation from the
Pope.'</p>

<p>'A hard nut that for a heretic,' laughed the Abbess.</p>

<p>'He acted the ignorant--knew nothing about the young lady; but
had the civility to give me a guide and an escort to go to
Quinet.&nbsp; <i>Ma foi</i>! I believe they were given to hinder
me--take me by indirect roads, make me lose time at chateaux.&nbsp;
When I arrived at the grim old chateau--a true dungeon, precise as
a convent--there was the dame, playing the Queen Jeanne as well as
she could, and having the insolence to tell me that it was true
that Madame la Baronne de Ribaumont, as she was pleased to call
her, had honoured her residence for some months, but that she had
now quitted it, and she flatly refused to answer any question
whither she was gone!&nbsp; The hag! she might at least have had
the decorum to deny all knowledge of her, but nothing is more
impertinent that the hypocritical sincerity of the heretics.'</p>

<p>'But her people,' exclaimed the Abbess; 'surely some of them
knew, and could be brought to speak.'</p>

<p>'All the servants I came in contact with played the
incorruptible; but still I have done something.&nbsp; There were
some fellows in the village who are not at their ease under that
rule.&nbsp; I caused my people to inquire them out.&nbsp; They knew
nothing more than that the old heretic Gardon with his family had
gone away in Madame la Duchesse's litter, but whither they could
not tell. But the <i>cabaretier</i> there is furious secretly with
the Quinets for having spoilt his trade by destroying the shrine at
the holy well, and I have made him understand that it will be for
his profit to send me off intelligence so soon as there is any
communication between them and the lady.&nbsp; I made the same
arrangement with a couple of gendarmes of the escort the Duke gave
me.&nbsp; So at least we are safe for intelligence such as would
hinder a marriage.'</p>

<p>'But they will be off to England!' said the Abbess.</p>

<p>'I wager they will again write to make sure of a
reception.&nbsp; Moreover, I have set that fellow Ercole and others
of his trade to keep a strict watch on all the roads leading to the
ports, and give me due notice of their passing thither.&nbsp; We
have law on our side, and, did I once claim her, no one could
resist my right.&nbsp; Or should the war break out, as is probable,
then could my son sweep their whole province with his troops.&nbsp;
This time she cannot escape us.'</p>

<p>The scene that her father's words and her own imagination
conjured up, of Eustacie attracting the handsome widower-duke,
removed all remaining scruples from Madame de Selinville.&nbsp; For
his own sake, the Baron must be made to fulfil the prophecy of the
ink-pool, and allow his prison doors to be opened by love.&nbsp;
Many and many a tender art did Diane rehearse; numerous were her
sighs; wakeful, languishing, and restless her nights and days; and
yet, whatever her determination to practise upon her cousin the
witcheries that she had learnt in the <i>Escadron de la
Reine-mere</i>, and seen played off effectually where there was not
one grain of love to inspire them, her powers and her courage
always failed her in the presence of him whom she sought to
attract.&nbsp; His quiet reserve and simplicity always disconcerted
her, and any attempt at blandishment that he could not mistake was
always treated by him as necessarily an accidental error, as if any
other supposition would render her despicable; and yet there was
now and then a something that made her detect an effort in his
restraint, as if it were less distaste than self-command.&nbsp; Her
brother had contemptuously acquiesced in the experiment made by
herself and her father, and allowed that so long as there was any
danger of the Quinet marriage, the Baron's existence was needful.
He would not come to Nid-de-Merle, nor did they want him there,
knowing that he could hardly have kept his hands off his
rival.&nbsp; But when the war broke out again in the summer of 1575
he joined that detachment of Guise's army which hovered about the
Loire, and kept watch on the Huguenot cities and provinces of
Western France.&nbsp; The Chevalier made several expeditions to
confer with his son, and to keep up his relations with the network
of spies whom he had spread over the Quinet provinces.&nbsp; The
prisoners were so much separated from all intercourse with the
dependants that they were entirely ignorant of the object of his
absence from home.&nbsp; On these occasions they never left their
tower and its court, and had no enlivenment save an occasional gift
of dainties or message of inquiry from the ladies at
Bellaise.&nbsp; These were brought by a handsome but slight, pale
lad called Aime de Selinville, a relative of the late Count, as he
told them, who had come to act as a gentleman attendant upon the
widowed countess.&nbsp; The brothers rather wondered how he was
disposed of at the convent, but all there was so contrary to their
preconceived notions that they acquiesced.&nbsp; The first time he
arrived it was on a long, hot summer day, and he then brought them
a cool iced sherbet in two separate flasks, that for Philip being
mixed with wine, which was omitted for Berenger; and the youth
stood lingering and watching, anxious, he said, to be able to tell
his lady how the drinks were approved.&nbsp; Both were excellent,
and to that effect the prisoners replied; but no sooner was the
messenger gone than Berenger said smilingly, 'That was a love
potion, Phil.'</p>

<p>'And you drank it!' cried Philip, in horror.</p>

<p>'I did not think of it till I saw how the boy's eyes were gazing
curiously at me as I swallowed it.&nbsp; You look at me as
curiously, Phil.&nbsp; Are you expecting it to work?&nbsp; Shall I
be at the fair lady's feet next time we meet?'</p>

<p>'How can you defy it, Berry?'</p>

<p>'Nay, Phil; holy wedded love is not to be dispelled by a
mountebank's decoction.'</p>

<p>'But suppose it were poisonous, Berry, what can be done?' cried
Philip, starting up in dismay.</p>

<p>'Then you would go home, Phil, and this would be over.&nbsp;
But'-- seeing his brother's terror--'there is no fear of
that.&nbsp; She is not like to wish to poison me.'</p>

<p>And the potion proved equally ineffective on mind and body, as
indeed did all the manipulations exercised upon a little waxen
image that was supposed to represent M. le Baron.&nbsp; Another
figure was offered to Diane, in feminine form, with black beads for
eyes and a black plaster for hair, which, when stuck full of pins
and roasted before the fire, was to cause Eustacie to peak and pine
correspondingly.&nbsp; But from this measure Diane shrank.&nbsp; If
aught was done against her rival it must be by her father and
brother, not by herself; and she would not feel herself directly
injuring her little cousin, nor sinking herself below him whom she
loved.&nbsp; Once his wife, she would be good for ever, held up by
his strength.</p>

<p>Meantime Berenger had received a greater shock than she or her
father understood in the looking over of some of the family
parchments kept in store at the castle.&nbsp; The Chevalier, in
showing them to him, had chiefly desired to glorify the family by
demonstrating how its honours had been won, but Berenger was
startled at finding that Nid-de-Merle had been, as it appeared to
him, arbitrarily and unjustly declared to be forfeited by the Sieur
de Bellaise, who had been thrown into prison by Louis XI. for some
demonstration in favour of the poor Duke de Berri, and granted to
the favourite Ribaumont.&nbsp; The original grant was there, and to
his surprise he found it was to male heirs--the male heirs alone of
the direct line of the Ribaumont--to whom the grant was made.&nbsp;
How, then, came it to Eustacie?&nbsp; The disposal had, with almost
equal injustice, been changed by King Henry II. and the late Count
de Ribaumont in favour of the little daughter whose union with the
heir of the elder line was to conclude all family feuds.&nbsp; Only
now did Berenger understand what his father had said on his
death-bed of flagrant injustice committed in his days of
darkness.&nbsp; He felt that he was reaping the reward of the
injuries committed against the Chevalier and his son on behalf of
the two unconscious children.&nbsp; He would willingly at once have
given up all claim to the Nid-de-Merle estate--and he was now of
age; two birthdays had passed in his captivity and brought him to
years of discretion--but he had no more power than before to
dispose of what was the property of Eustacie and her child; and the
whole question of the validity of his marriage would be given up by
his yielding even the posthumous claim that might have devolved on
him in case of Eustacie's death.&nbsp; This would be giving up her
honour, a thing impossible.</p>

<p>'Alas!' he sighed, 'my poor father might well say he had bound a
heavy burthen round my neck.'</p>

<p>And from that time his hopes sank lower as the sense of the
justice of his cause left him.&nbsp; He could neither deny his
religion nor his marriage, and therefore could do nothing for his
own deliverance; and he knew himself to be suffering in the cause
of a great injustice; indeed, to be bringing suffering on the still
more innocent Philip.</p>

<p>The once proudly indifferent youth was flagging now; was losing
appetite, flesh, and colour; was unwilling to talk or to take
exercise; and had a wan and drooping air that was most painful to
watch.&nbsp; It seemed as if the return of summer brought a sense
of the length and weariness of the captivity, and that the sunshine
and gaiety of the landscape had become such a contrast to the
captives' deadness of spirit that they could hardly bear to behold
them, and felt the dull prison walls more congenial to their
feelings than the gaiety of the summer hay and harvest-fields.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII.&nbsp; BEATING AGAINST THE BARS</h3>

<p>My horse is weary of the stall,</p>

<p>And I am sick of captive thrall.--LADY OF THE LAKE</p>

<p>Letters!&nbsp; They were hailed like drops of water in a thirsty
land.&nbsp; No doubt they had been long on the way, ere they had
reached the hands of the Chevalier de Ribaumont, and it was quite
possible that they had been read and selected; but, as Berenger
said, he defied any Frenchman to imitate either Lord Walwyn's style
or Sir Marmaduke's, and when late in the autumn the packet was
delivered to him, the two captives gloated over the very outsides
before they opened them.</p>

<p>The first intelligence that greeted them made them give a cry of
amusement and surprise.&nbsp; Lady Thistlewood, whose regrets that
each of her girls was not a boy had passed into a proverb, had at
length, in Dolly's seventh year, given birth to a son on Midsummer
Day.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Philip, sighing, 'we must drink his health
tonight!&nbsp; It is well, if we are to rot here, that some one
should make it up to them!'</p>

<p>'And join Walwyn and Hurst!' said Berenger; and then both faces
grew much graver, as by these letters, dated three months since,
they understood how many they must have missed, and likewise that
nothing had been heard of themselves since they had left Paris
sixteen months ago.&nbsp; Their letters, both to their relations
and to Sir Francis Walsingham, had evidently been suppressed; and
Lord North, who had succeeded Walsingham as ambassador, had
probably been misled by design, either by Narcisse de Nid-de-Merle
himself, or by some of his agents, for Lord Walwyn had heard from
him that the young men were loitering among the castles and
garrisons of Anjou, leading a gay and dissipated life, and that it
was universally believed that the Baron de Ribaumont had embraced
the Catholic faith, and would shortly be presented to Henry III. to
receive the grant of the Selinville honours, upon his marriage with
his cousin, the widow of the last of the line.&nbsp; With much
earnestness and sorrow did good old Lord Walwyn write to his
grandson, conjuring him to bethink himself of his some, his pure
faith, his loving friends, and the hopes of his youth: and, at
least, if he himself had been led away by the allurements of the
other party, to remember that Philip had been intrusted to him in
full confidence, and to return him to his home.&nbsp; 'It was grief
and shame to him,' said the good old man, 'to look at Sir
Marmaduke, who had risked his son in the charge of one hitherto
deemed trustworthy; and even if Berenger had indeed forgotten and
cast away those whom he had once seemed to regard with love and
duty, he commanded him to send home Philip, who owed an obedience
to his father that could not be gainsaid.' Lord Walwyn further bade
his grandson remember that the arrangements respecting his
inheritance had been made in confidence that his heir was English
in heart and faith, and that neither the Queen nor his own
conscience would allow him to let his inheritance pass into French
of Papist hands.&nbsp; There was scarcely a direct reproach, but
the shaken, altered handwriting showed how stricken the aged man
must be; and after his signature was added one still more trembling
line, 'An ye return not speedily, ye will never see the old
grandsire more.'</p>

<p>Berenger scarcely finished the letter through his burning tears
of agony, and then, casting it from him, began to pace the room in
fierce agitation, bursting out into incoherent exclamations,
grasping at his hair, even launching himself against the massive
window with such frenzied gestures and wild words that Philip, who
had read through all with his usual silent obtuseness, became
dismayed, and, laying hold of him, said, 'Prithee, brother, do not
thus!&nbsp; What serves such passion?'</p>

<p>Berenger burst into a strange loud laugh at the matter-of-fact
tone.&nbsp; 'What serves it! what serves anything!' he cried, 'but
to make me feel what a miserable wretch I am?&nbsp; But he will
die, Philip--he will die--not having believed me!&nbsp; How shall
we keep ourselves from the smooth-tongued villain's throat?&nbsp;
That I should be thus judged a traitor by my grandfather----'</p>

<p>And with a cry as of bodily anguish, he hid his face on the
table, and groaned as he felt the utter helplessness of his strong
youth in bonds.</p>

<p>'It can't be helped,' was the next of the unconsolatory
platitudes uttered by Philip, who always grew sullen and dogged
when his brother's French temperament broke forth under any sudden
stroke.&nbsp; 'If they will believe such things, let them!&nbsp;
You have not heard what my father says to it.'</p>

<p>'It will be all the same,' groaned Berenger.</p>

<p>'Nay! now that's a foul slander, and you should be ashamed of
doing my father such wrong,' said Philip,&nbsp; 'Listen;' and he
read:&nbsp; 'I will believe no ill of the lad no more than of thee,
Phil.&nbsp; It is but a wild-goose chase, and the poor young woman
is scarce like to be above ground; but, as I daily tell them, 'tis
hard a man should forfeit his land for seeking his wife.&nbsp; My
Lord North sends rumours that he is under Papist guiding, and sworn
brother with the Black Ribaumonts; and my Lady, his grandmother, is
like to break her heart, and my Lord credits them more than he
ought, and never a line as a token comes from you.&nbsp; Then
there's Dame Annora, as proud of the babe as though neither she nor
woman born ever had a son before, and plains over him, that both
his brothers should be endowed, and he but a younger son.&nbsp;
What will be the end on't I cannot tell.&nbsp; I will stand up for
the right as best man may do, and never forget that Berry is her
first-born, and that his child may be living; but the matter is
none of mine, and my Lord is very aged, nor can a man meddle
between his wife and her father.&nbsp; So this I tell you that you
may make your brother lay it to heart.&nbsp; The sooner he is here
the better, if he be still, as I verily believe and maintain him to
be, an honest English heart that snaps his fingers at French
papistry.'&nbsp; 'There,' conclude Philip triumphantly, 'he knows
an honest man!&nbsp; He's friend and good father to you as much as
ever.&nbsp; Heed none of the rest.&nbsp; He'll never let this
little rogue stand in your light.'</p>

<p>'as if I cared for that!' said Berenger, beginning his
caged-tiger walk again, and, though he tried to repress his
anguish, breaking out at times into fierce revilings of the cruel
toils that beset him, and despairing lamentations over those
beloved ones at home, with sobs, groans, and tears, such as Philip
could not brook to witness. Both because they were so violent and
mourn-full, and because he thought them womanish, though in effect
no woman's grief could have had half that despairing force.&nbsp;
The <i>fierte</i> of the French noble, however, came to his
aid.&nbsp; At the first sound of the great supper-bell he dashed
away his tears, composed his features, washed his face, and
demanded haughtily of Philip, whether there were any traces in his
looks that the cruel hypocrite, their jailer, could gloat over.</p>

<p>And with proud step and indifferent air he marched into the
hall, answered the Chevalier's polite inquiry whether the letter
had brought good tidings by coolly thanking him and saying that all
at home were well; and when he met the old man's inquiring glance
out of the little keen black bead in the puckered, withered eyelid,
he put a perfectly stony unmeaningness into his own gaze, till his
eyes looked like the blue porcelain from China so much prized by
the Abbess.&nbsp; He even played at chess all the evening with such
concentrated attention as to be uniformly victorious.</p>

<p>Yet half the night Philip heard suppressed moans and sobs--then
knew that he was on his knees--then, after long and comparatively
silent weeping, he lay down again, and from the hour when he awoke
in the morning, he returned no more to the letters; and though for
some little time more sad and dispirited, he seemed to have come to
regard the misjudgment at home as a part of the burthen he was
already bearing.</p>

<p>That burthen was, however, pressing more heavily.&nbsp; The
temperaments of the two brothers so differed that while the French
one was prostrated by the agony of a stroke, and then rallied
patiently to endure the effects, the English character opposed a
passive resistance to the blow, gave no sign of grief or pain, and
from that very determination suffered a sort of exhaustion that
made the effects of the evil more and more left.&nbsp; Thus, from
the time Philip's somewhat tardy imagination had been made to
realize his home, his father, and his sisters, the home-sickness,
and weariness of his captivity, which had already begun to
undermine his health and spirits, took increasing effect.</p>

<p>He made no complaint--he never expressed a wish--but, in the
words of the prophet, he seemed 'pining away on his feet.'&nbsp; He
did not sleep, and though, to avoid remark, he never failed to
appear at meals, he scarcely tasted food.&nbsp; He never willingly
stirred from cowering over the fire, and was so surly and
ill-tempered that only Berenger's unfailing good-humour could have
endured it.&nbsp; Even a wolf-hunt did not stir him.&nbsp; He only
said he hated outlandish beasts, and that it was not like chasing
the hare in Dorset.&nbsp; His calf-love for Madame de Selinville
had entirely faded away in his yearnings after home.&nbsp; She was
only one of the tediously recurring sights of his captivity, and
was loathed like all the rest.&nbsp; The regulation rides with the
Chevalier were more detestable than ever, and by and by they caused
such fatigue that Berenger perceived that his strength must be
warning, and became so seriously alarmed that one evening, when
Philip had barely dragged himself to the hall, tasted nothing but a
few drops of wine, and then dropped into an uneasy slumber in his
chair, he could not but turn to the Chevalier an appealing,
indignant countenance, as he said, in a low but quivering voice,
'You see, sir, how he is altered!'</p>

<p>'Alas! fair nephew, it is but too plain.&nbsp; He is just of the
age when such restraint tells severely upon the health.'</p>

<p>Then Berenger spoke out upon the foul iniquity of the boy's
detention.&nbsp; For himself, he observed, he had nothing to say;
he knew the term of his release, and had not accepted them; but
Philip, innocent of all damage to the Ribaumont interests, the heir
of an honourable family, what had he done to incur the cruel
imprisonment that was eating away his life?</p>

<p>'I tell you, sir,' said Berenger, with eyes filled with tears,'
that his liberty is more precious to me than my own. Were he but
restored to our home, full half the weight would be gone from my
spirit.'</p>

<p>'Fair nephew,' said the Chevalier, 'you speak as though I had
any power in the matter, and were not merely standing between you
and the King.'</p>

<p>'Then if so,' said Berenger, 'let the King do as he will with
me, but let Philip's case be known to our Ambassador.'</p>

<p>'My poor cousin,' said the Chevalier, 'you know not what you
ask.&nbsp; Did I grant your desire, you would only learn how
implacable King Henri is to those who have personally offended
him--above all, to heretics.&nbsp; Nor could the Ambassador do
anything for one who resisted by force of arms the King's
justice.&nbsp; Leave it to me; put yourself in my hands, and
deliverance shall come for him first, then for you.'</p>

<p>'How, sir?'</p>

<p>'One token of concession--one attendance at mass--one pledge
that the alliance shall take place when the formalities have been
complied with--then can I report you our own; give you almost
freedom at once; despatch our young friend to England without loss
of time; so will brotherly affection conquer those chivalrous
scruples, most honourable in you, but which, carried too far,
become cruel obstinacy.'</p>

<p>Berenger looked at Philip; saw how faded and wan was the ruddy
sun-burnt complexion, how lank and bony the sturdy form, how
listless and wasted the hands.&nbsp; Then arose, bursting within
him, the devoted generosity of the French nature, which would even
accept sin and ruin for self, that so the friend may be saved; and
after all, had he not gone to mass out of mere curiosity?--did he
not believe that there was salvation in the Gallican Church?&nbsp;
Was it not possible that, with Philip free to tell his story at
home, his own deliverance might come before he should be
irrevocably committed to Madame de Selinville?&nbsp; If Eustacie
were living, her claims must overthrow that which her rival was
forcing upon him at her own peril.&nbsp; Nay, how else could he
obtain tidings of her?&nbsp; And for those at home, did they
deserve that he should sacrifice all, Philip included, for their
sake?&nbsp; The thoughts, long floating round his brain, now surged
upon him in one flood, and seemed to overwhelm in those moments of
confusion all his powers of calling up the other side of the
argument; he only had an instinct remaining that it would be a lie
to God and man alike.&nbsp; 'God help me!' he sighed to himself;
and there was sufficient consideration and perplexity expressed in
his countenance to cause the Chevalier to feel his cause almost
gained; and rising eagerly, with tears in his eyes, he exclaimed,
'Embrace me, my dear, dear son!&nbsp; The thing is done!&nbsp; Oh!
what peace, what joy!'</p>

<p>The instinct of recoil came stronger now.&nbsp; He stepped back
with folded arms, saying again, 'God help me!&nbsp; God forbid that
I should be a traitor!'</p>

<p>'My son, hear me; these are but easily removed points of
honour,' began the Chevalier; but at that moment Philip suddenly
started from, or in his slumber, leapt on his feet, and called out,
'Avaunt, Satan!' then opened his eyes, and looked, as if barely
recalling where he was.</p>

<p>'Philip!' exclaimed Berenger, 'did you hear?'</p>

<p>'I--I don't know,' he said, half-bewildered.&nbsp; 'Was I
dreaming that the fiend was parleying with us in the voice of M. le
Chevalier there to sell our souls for one hour of home?'</p>

<p>He spoke English, but Berenger replied in French.</p>

<p>'You were not wrong, Philip.&nbsp; Sir, he dreamt that the devil
was tempting me in your voice while you were promising me his
liberty on my fulfilling your first condition.'</p>

<p>'What?' said Philip, now fully awake, and gathering the state of
things, as he remembered the words that had doubtless been the
cause of his dream.&nbsp; 'And if you did, Berenger, I give you
warning they should never see me at home.&nbsp; What! could I show
my face there with such tidings?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I should go
straight to La Noue, or to the Low Countries, and kill every Papist
I could for having debauched you!'</p>

<p>'Hush! hush!&nbsp; Philip,' said Berenger; 'I could not break my
faith to Heaven or my wife even for your sake, and my cousin sees
how little beholden you would be to me for so doing.&nbsp; With
your leave, Monsieur, we will retire.'</p>

<p>The Chevalier detained Berenger for a moment to whisper, 'What I
see is so noble a heart that I know you cannot sacrifice him to
your punctilio.'</p>

<p>Philip was so angry with Berenger, so excited, and so determined
to show that nothing ailed him, that for a short time he was
roused, and seemed to be recovering; but in a few days he flagged
again, only, if possible with more gruffness, moodiness, and
pertinacity in not allowing that anything was amiss.&nbsp; It was
the bitterest drop of all in Berenger's cup, when in the end of
January he looked back at what Philip had been only a month before,
and saw how he had wasted away and lost strength; the impulse
rather to ruin himself that destroy his brother came with such
force that he could scarcely escape it by his ever-recurring cry
for help to withstand it.&nbsp; And then Diane, in her splendid
beauty and witchery, would rise before him, so that he knew how a
relaxation of the lengthened weary effort would make his whole self
break its bonds and go out to her.&nbsp; Dreams of felicity and
liberty, and not with Eustacie, would even come over him, and he
would awaken to disappointment before he came to a sense of relief
and thankfulness that he was still his own.&nbsp; The dislike,
distaste, and dread that came so easily in his time of pain and
weakness were less easy to maintain in his full health and forced
inactivity.&nbsp; Occupation of mind and hope seemed the only
chance of enabling either of the two to weather this most dreary
desert period; and Berenger, setting his thoughts resolutely to
consider what would be the best means of rousing Philip, decided at
length that any endeavour to escape, however arduous and desperate,
would be better than his present apathetic languor, even if it led
to nothing.&nbsp; After the first examination of their prison,
Berenger had had no thought of escape; he was then still weak and
unenterprising.&nbsp; He had for many months lived in hopes of
interference from home; and, besides, the likelihood that so
English a party as his own would be quickly pursued and recaptured,
where they did not know their road and had no passports, had
deterred him lest should fall into still straiter
imprisonment.&nbsp; But he had since gained, in the course of his
rides, and by observation from the top of the tower, a much fuller
knowledge of the country.&nbsp; He knew the way to the grange du
Temple, and to the chief towns in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Philip
and Humfrey had both lost something of their intensely national
look and speech, and, moreover, was having broken out again, there
was hope of falling in with Huguenot partisans even nearer that at
La Rochelle.&nbsp; But whether successful or not, some enterprise
was absolutely needed to save Philip from his despondent apathy;
and Berenger, who in these eighteen months had grown into the
strength and vigour of manhood, felt as if he had force and power
for almost any effort save this hopeless waiting.</p>

<p>He held council with Humfrey, who suggested that it might be
well to examine the vaults below the keep.&nbsp; He had a few days
before, while going after some of the firewood stored below the
ground-floor chamber, observed a door, locked, but with such rusty
iron hinges that they might possibly yield to vigorous efforts with
a stone; and who could tell where the underground passages might
come out?</p>

<p>Berenger eagerly seized the idea.&nbsp; Philip's mood of
contradiction prompted him to pronounce it useless folly, and he
vouchsafed no interest in the arrangements for securing light, by
selecting all the bits of firewood fittest for torches, and saving
all the oil possible from the two lamps they were allowed.&nbsp;
The chief difficulty was that Guibert was not trusted, so that all
had to be done out of his sight; and on the first day Berenger was
obliged to make the exploration alone, since Humfrey was forced to
engross Guibert in some occupation out of sight, and Philip had
refused to have anything to do with it, or be like a rat routing in
the corners of his trap.</p>

<p>However, Berenger had only just ascertained that the ironwork
was so entirely rusted away as to offer no impediment, when Philip
came languidly roaming into the cellar, saying, 'Here!&nbsp; I'll
hold the torch!&nbsp; You'll be losing yourself in this wolf's
mouth of a place if you go alone.'</p>

<p>The investigation justified Philip's predictions of its
uselessness.&nbsp; Nothing was detected but rats, and vaults, and
cobwebs; it was cold, earthy, and damp; and when they thought they
must have penetrated far beyond the precincts of the keep, they
heard Humfrey's voice close to them, warning them that it was
nearly dinner-time.</p>

<p>The next day brought them a more promising discovery, namely of
a long straight passage, with a gleam of light at the end of it;
and this for the first time excited Philip's interest or
curiosity.&nbsp; He would have hastened along it at once, but for
the warning summons from Humfrey; and in the excitement of even
this grain of interest, he ate more heartily at supper than he had
done for weeks, and was afterwards more eager to prove to Berenger
that night was the best time to pursue their researches.</p>

<p>And Berenger, when convinced that Guibert was sound asleep,
thought so too, and accompanied by Humfrey, they descended into the
passage.&nbsp; The light, of course, was no longer visible, but the
form of the crypt, through which they now passed, was less antique
than that under the keep, and it was plain they were beneath a
later portion of the Castle.&nbsp; The gallery concluded in a wall,
with a small barred, unglazed window, perfectly dark, so that
Berenger, who alone could reach to the bottom of it, could not uses
where it looked out.</p>

<p>'We must return by daylight; then, maybe, we may judge,' sighed
Philip.</p>

<p>'Hark!' exclaimed Berenger.</p>

<p>'Rats,' said Philip.</p>

<p>'No--listen--a voice!&nbsp; Take care!' he added, in a lower
tone, 'we may be close on some of the servants.'</p>

<p>But, much nearer than he expected, a voice on his right hand
demanded, 'Does any good Christian hear me?'</p>

<p>'Who is there?' exclaimed Philip.</p>

<p>'Ah! good sir, do I hear the voice of a companion in
misery?&nbsp; Or, if you be free, would you but send tidings to my
poor father?'</p>

<p>'It is a Norman accent!' cried Berenger.&nbsp; 'Ah! ah! can it
be poor Landry Osbert?'</p>

<p>'I am--I am that wretch.&nbsp; Oh, would that M. le Baron could
know!'</p>

<p>'My dear, faithful foster-brother!&nbsp; They deceived me,'
cried Berenger, in great agitation, as an absolute howl came from
the other side of the wall:&nbsp; 'M. le Baron come to this!&nbsp;
Woe worth the day!' and Berenger with difficulty mitigated his
affectionate servant's lamentations enough to learn from him how he
had been seized almost at the gates of Bellaise, closely
interrogated, deprived of the letter to Madame la Baronne, and
thrown into this dungeon.&nbsp; The Chevalier. Not an unmerciful
man, according to the time, had probably meant to release him as
soon as the marriage between his son and niece should have rendered
it superfluous to detain this witness to Berenger's
existence.&nbsp; There, then, the poor fellow had lain for three
years, and his work during this weary time had been the scraping
with a potsherd at the stone of his wall, and his pertinacious
perseverance had succeeded in forming a hole just large enough to
enable him to see the light of the torch carried by the
gentlemen.&nbsp; On his side, he said, there was nothing but a
strong iron door, and a heavily-barred window, looking, like that
in the passage, into the fosse within the walled garden; but, on
the other hand, if he could enlarge his hole sufficiently to creep
through it, he could escape with them in case of their finding a
subterranean outlet.&nbsp; The opening within his cell was, of
course, much larger than the very small space he had made by
loosening a stone towards the passage, but he was obliged always to
build up each side of his burrow at the hours of his jailer's
visit, lest his work should be detected, and to stamp the rubbish
into his floor.&nbsp; But while they talked, Humfrey and Philip,
with their knives, scraped so diligently that two more stones could
be displaced; and, looking down the widening hole through the
prodigious mass of wall, they could see a ghastly, ragged,
long-bearded scarecrow, with an almost piteous expression of joy on
his face, at once again seeing familiar faces.&nbsp; And when, at
his earnest entreaty, Berenger stood so as to allow his countenance
to be as visible as the torch could make it through the
'wall's-hole,' the vault echoed with the poor fellow's delighted
cry.&nbsp; 'I am happy! M. le Baron is himself again.&nbsp; The
assassin's cruel work is gone!&nbsp; Ah! thanks to the
saints!&nbsp; Blessed be St. Lucie, it was not in vain that I
entreated her!'</p>

<p>The torches were, however, waxing so low that the sight could
not long be afforded poor Osbert; and, with a promise to return to
him next day, the party returned to the upper air, where they
warmed themselves over the fire, and held council over measures for
the present relief of the captive.&nbsp; Berenger grieved that he
had given him up so entirely for lost as to have made no exertions
on his behalf, and declared his resolution of entreating that he
might be allowed to enjoy comparative comfort with them in the
keep.&nbsp; It was a risk, but the Chevalier might fairly suppose
that the knowledge of Osbert's situation had oozed out through the
servants, and gratitude and humanity alike impelled Berenger to run
some risk for his foster-brother's sake.&nbsp; He was greatly
touched at the poor fellow's devotion, and somewhat amused, though
with an almost tearful smile at the joy with which he had
proclaimed--what Berenger was quite unaware of, since the keep
furnished no mirrors--the disappearance of his scars.&nbsp; ''Tis
even so,' said Philip, 'though I never heeded it.&nbsp; You are as
white from crown to beard as one of the statues at Paris; but the
great red gash is a mere seam, save when yon old Satan angers you,
and then it blushes for all the rest of your face.'</p>

<p>'And the cheek-wound is hidden, I suppose,' said Berenger,
feeling under the long fair moustache and the beard, which was
developing into respectable proportions.</p>

<p>'Hidden? ay, entirely.&nbsp; No one would think your bald crown
had only twenty-one years over it; but you are a personable fellow
still, quite enough to please Daphne,' said Philip.</p>

<p>'Pshaw!' replied Berenger, pleased nevertheless to hear the
shadow of a jest again from Philip.</p>

<p>It was quite true.&nbsp; These months of quiescence--enforced
though they were--had given his health and constitution time to
rally after the terrible shock they had sustained.&nbsp; The severe
bleedings had, indeed, rendered his complexion perfectly
colourless; but there was something in this, as well as in the
height which the loss of hair gave his brow, which, added to the
depth and loftiness of countenance that this long period of
patience and resolution had impressed on his naturally fine
features, without taking away that open candour that had first
attracted Diane when he was a rosy lad.&nbsp; His frame had
strengthened at the same time, and assumed the proportions of
manhood; so that, instead of being the overgrown maypole that
Narcisse used to sneer at, he was now broad-shouldered and robust,
exceedingly powerful, and so well made that his height, upwards of
six feet, was scarcely observed, except by comparison with the rest
of the world.</p>

<p>And his character had not stood still.&nbsp; He had first come
to Paris a good, honest, docile, though high-spirited boy: and
though manly affections, cares, and sorrows had been thrust on him,
he had met them like the boy that he was, hardly conscious how deep
they went.&nbsp; Then had come the long dream of physical
suffering, with only one thought pertinaciously held
throughout--that of constancy to his lost wife; and from this he
had only thoroughly wakened in his captivity, the resolution still
holding fast, but with more of reflection and principle, less of
mere instinct, than when his powers were lost or distracted in the
effort of constant endurance of pain and weakness.&nbsp; The charge
of Philip, the endeavour both of educating him and keeping up his
spirits, as well as the controversy with Pere Bonami, had been no
insignificant parts of the discipline of these months; and, little
as the Chevalier had intended it, he had trained his young kinsman
into a far more substantial and perilous adversary, both in body
and mind, than when he had caged him in his castle of the
Blackbird's Nest.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII.&nbsp; THE ENEMY IN PRESENCE</h3>

<p>Then came and looked him in the face,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angel beautiful and bright,</p>

<p>And then he knew it was a fiend,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That miserable knight.--COLERIDGE</p>

<p>'Father, dear father, what is it?&nbsp; What makes you look so
ill, so haggard?' cried Diane de Selinville, when summoned the next
morning to meet her father in the parlour of the convent.</p>

<p>'Ah, child! see here.&nbsp; Your brother will have us make an
end of it.&nbsp; He has found her.'</p>

<p>'Eustacie!&nbsp; Ah, and where?'</p>

<p>'That he will not say, but see here.&nbsp; This is all billet
tells me:</p>

<p>"The hare who has doubled so long is traced to her form.&nbsp;
My dogs are on her, and in a week's time she will be ours.&nbsp; I
request you, sir, to send me a good purse of crowns to reward my
huntsmen; and in the meantime--one way or the other--that pet of my
sister's must be disposed of.&nbsp; Kept too long, these beasts
always become savage.&nbsp; Either let him be presented to the
royal menagerie, or there is a still surer way."'</p>

<p>'And that is all he says!' exclaimed Diane.</p>

<p>'All!&nbsp; He was always cautions.&nbsp; He mentions no
names.&nbsp; And now, child, what is to be done?&nbsp; To give him
up to the King is, at the best, life-long imprisonment, yet, if he
were still here when my son returns-- Alas! alas! child, I have
been ruined body and soul between you!&nbsp; How could you make me
send after and imprison him?&nbsp; It was a mere assassination!'
and the old man beat his head with grief and perplexity.</p>

<p>'Father!' cried Diane, tearfully, 'I cannot see you thus.&nbsp;
We meant it for the best.&nbsp; We shall yet save him.'</p>

<p>'Save him!&nbsp; Ah, daughter, I tossed all night long thinking
how to save him, so strong, so noble, so firm, so patient, so good
even to the old man who has destroyed his hope--his life!&nbsp;
Ah!&nbsp; I have thought till my brain whirls.'</p>

<p>'Poor father!&nbsp; I knew you would love him,' said Diane,
tenderly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Ah!&nbsp; we will save him yet.&nbsp; He shall be the best of
sons to you.&nbsp; Look, it is only to tell him that she whom he
calls his wife is already in my brother's hands, wedded to
him.'</p>

<p>'Daughter,'--and he pushed back his gray hair with a weary
distressed gesture,--'I am tired of wiles; I am old; I can carry
them out no longer.'</p>

<p>'But this is very simple; it may already be true--at least it
will soon be true.&nbsp; Only tell him that she is my brother's
wife.&nbsp; Then will his generosity awaken, then will he see that
to persist in the validity of his marriage would be misery,
dishonour to her, then---'</p>

<p>'Child, you know not how hard he is in his sense of right.&nbsp;
Even for his brother's sake he would not give way an inch, and the
boy was as obstinate as he!'</p>

<p>'Ah! but this comes nearer.&nbsp; He will be stung; his
generosity will be piqued.&nbsp; He will see that the kindest thing
he can do will be to nullify his claim, and the child----'</p>

<p>The Chevalier groaned, struck his brow with his fist, and
muttered, 'That will concern no one--that has been provided
for.&nbsp; Ah! ah! children, if I lose my own soul for you,
you----'</p>

<p>'Father, my sweet father, say not these cruel things.&nbsp; Did
not the Queen's confessor tell us that all means were lawful that
brought a soul to the Church? and here are two.'</p>

<p>'Two!&nbsp; Why, the youth's heresy is part of his point of
honour.&nbsp; Child, child, the two will be murdered in my very
house, and the guilt will be on my soul.'</p>

<p>'No, father!&nbsp; We will--we will save him.&nbsp; See, only
tell him this.'</p>

<p>'This--what?&nbsp; My brain is confused.&nbsp; I have thought
long--long.'</p>

<p>'Only this, father, dear father.&nbsp; You shall not be
tormented any more, if only you will tell him that my brother has
made Eustacie his wife, then will I do all the rest.'</p>

<p>Diane coaxed, soothed, and encouraged her father by her
caresses, till he mounted his mule to return to the castle at
dinner-time, and she promised to come early in the afternoon to
follow up the stroke he was to give.&nbsp; She had never seen him
falter before,--he had followed out his policy with a clear head
and unsparing hand,-- but now that Berenger's character was better
known to him, and the crisis long delayed had come so suddenly
before his eyes, his whole powers seemed to reel under the
alternative.</p>

<p>The dinner-bell clanged as he arrived at the castle, and the
prisoners were marched into the hall, both intent upon making their
request on Osbert's behalf, and therefore as impatient for the
conclusion of the meal, and the absence of the servants, as was
their host.&nbsp; His hands trembled so much that Berenger was
obliged to carve for him; he made the merest feint of eating; and
now and then raised his hand to his head as if to bring back
scattered ideas.</p>

<p>The last servant quitted the room, when Berenger perceived that
the old man was hardly in a state to attend to his request, and yet
the miserable frost-bitten state of poor Landry seemed to compel
him to speak.</p>

<p>'Sir,' he began, 'you could do me a great kindness.'</p>

<p>The Chevalier looked up at him with glassy eyes.</p>

<p>'My son,' he said, with an effort, 'I also had something to
say.&nbsp; Ah! let me think.&nbsp; I have had enough.&nbsp; Call my
daughter,' he added, feeling helplessly with his hands, so that
Berenger started up in alarm, and received him in his arms just in
time to prevent his sinking to the floor senseless.</p>

<p>'It is a stroke,' exclaimed Berenger.&nbsp; 'Call, Phil!&nbsp;
Send the gendarmes.'</p>

<p>The gendarmes might be used to the sight of death of their own
causing, but they had a horror of that which came by Nature's
hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The purple face and loud gasps of the stricken man terrified
them out of their senses.&nbsp; <i>'C'est un coup,'</i> was the
cry, and they went clattering off to the servants.&nbsp; These, all
men but one old crone, came in a mass to the door, looked in,
beheld their master rigid and prostrate on the floor, supported by
the prisoner, and with fresh shrieks about 'Mesdames! a priest! a
doctor!' away they rushed.&nbsp; The two brothers were not in much
less consternation, only they retained their senses.&nbsp; Berenger
loosened the ruff and doublet, and bade Philip practice that art of
letting blood which he had learnt for his benefit.&nbsp; When
Madame de Selinville and her aunt, with their escort, having been
met half-way from Bellaise, arrived sooner than could have been
expected, they found every door open from hall to entrance gateway,
not a person keeping watch, and the old man lying deathlike upon
cushions in the hall, Philip bandaging his arm, and Berenger
rubbing his temples with wine and the hottest spices on the
table.&nbsp; 'He is better--he is alive,' said Berenger, as they
entered; and as both ladies would have fallen on him with shrieks
and sobs, he bade them listen, assured them that the only chance of
life was in immediate care, and entreated that bedding might be
brought down, and strong essences fetched to apply to the nose and
temples.&nbsp; They obeyed, and the sister infirmarer had arrived
from the convent, he had opened his eyes, and, as he saw Berenger,
tried to murmur something that sounded like <i>'Mon fils'.'</i></p>

<p>'He lives!--he speaks!--he can receive the sacraments!' was the
immediate exclamation; and as preparations began to be made, the
brothers saw that their presence was no longer needed, and returned
to their own tower.</p>

<p>'So, sir,' said the gendarme sergeant, as they walked down the
passage, 'you did not seize the moment for escape.'</p>

<p>'I never thought of it,' said Berenger.</p>

<p>'I hope, sir, you will not be the worse for it,' said the
sergeant.&nbsp; 'An honourable gentleman you have ever proved
yourself to me, and I will bear testimony that you did the poor old
gentleman no hurt; but nobles will have it their own way, and pay
little heed to a poor soldier.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, friend?'</p>

<p>'Why, you see, sir, it is unlucky that you two happened to be
alone with M. le Chevalier.&nbsp; No one can tell what may be said
when they seek an occasion against a person.'</p>

<p>To the brothers, however, this suggestion sounded so horrible
and unnatural, that they threw it from them.&nbsp; They applied
themselves at every moment possible to enlarging Osbert' hole, and
seeking an outlet from the dungeon; but this they had not been able
to discover, and it was necessary to be constantly on their guard
in visiting the vaults, lest their absence from their apartment
should be detected.&nbsp; They believed that if Narcisse arrived at
the castle, they should find in him a far less gentle jailer than
the poor old man, for whose state their kindly young hearts could
not but grieve.</p>

<p>They heard that he had recovered consciousness enough to have
made a sort of confession; and Pere Bonami brought them his formal
request, as a dying man, for their pardon for all the injuries he
had done them; but his speech was too much affected for any
specification of what these were.&nbsp; The first thing they heard
in early morning was that, in the course of the night, he had
breathed his last; and all day the bells of all the churches round
were answering one another with the slow, swinging, melancholy
notes of the knell.</p>

<p>In the early twilight, Pere Bonami brought a message that Madame
de Selinville requested M. le Baron to come and speak with her, and
he was accordingly conducted, with the gendarme behind him, to a
small chamber opening into the hall--the same where the
incantations of the Italian pedlar had been played off before
Philip and Diane.&nbsp; The gendarme remained outside the door by
which they entered the little dark room, only lighted by one little
lamp.</p>

<p>'Here, daughter,' said the priest, 'is your cousin.&nbsp; He can
answer the question you have so much at heart;' and with these
words Pere Bonami passed beneath the black curtain that covered the
entrance into the hall, admitting as he raised it for a moment a
floor of pure light from the wax tapers, and allowing the cadence
of the chanting of the priests to fall on the ear.&nbsp; At first
Berenger was scarcely able to discern the pale face that looked as
if tears were all dried up, and even before his eyes had clearly
perceived her in the gloom, she was standing before him with
clasped hands, demanding, in a hoarse, breathless whisper, 'Had he
said anything to you?'</p>

<p>'Anything?&nbsp; No, cousin,' said Berenger, in a kind
tone.&nbsp; 'He had seemed suffering and oppressed all dinner-time,
and when the servants left us, he murmured a few confused words,
then sank.'</p>

<p>'Ah, ah, he spoke it not!&nbsp; Thank Heaven!&nbsp; Ah! it is a
load gone.&nbsp; Then neither will I speak it,' sighed Diane, half
aloud.&nbsp; 'Ah!&nbsp; cousin, he loved you.'</p>

<p>'He often was kind to us,' said Berenger, impelled to speak as
tenderly as he could of the enemy, who had certainly tortured him,
but as if he loved him.</p>

<p>'He bade us save you,' said Diane, her eyes shining with strange
wild light in the gloom.&nbsp; 'He laid it on my aunt and me to
save you; you must let us. It must be done before my brother
comes,' she added, in hurried accents. 'The messengers are gone; he
may be here any moment.&nbsp; He must find you in the
chapel--as--as my betrothed!'</p>

<p>'And you sent for me here to tempt me--close to such a chamber
as that?' demanded Berenger, his gentleness becoming sternness, as
much with his own worse self as with her.</p>

<p>'Listen.&nbsp; Ah! it is the only way.&nbsp; Listen, cousin. Do
you know what killed my father?&nbsp; It was my brother's letter
saying things must be brought to an end: either you must be given
up to the King, or worse--worse.&nbsp; And now, without him to
stand between you and my brother, you are lost. &nbsp;Oh! take pity
on his poor soul that has left his body, and bring not you blood on
his head.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' said Berenger, 'if he repented, the after consequences to
me will have no effect on him now.'</p>

<p>'Have pity then on yourself--on your brother.'</p>

<p>'I have,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'He had rather die with me than
see me a traitor.'</p>

<p>'And least of all,' she exclaimed, with choking grief, 'have you
compassion on me!--on me who have lost the only one who felt for
me--on me who have loved you with every fibre of my heart--on me
who have lived on the music of your hardest, coldest word--on me
who would lay my life, my honour, in the dust for one grateful
glance from you--and whom you condemn to the anguish of--your
death!&nbsp; Aye, and for what?&nbsp; For the mere shadow of a
little girl, who had no force to love you, or whom you know
nothing--nothing!&nbsp; Oh! are you a crystal rock or are you a
man?&nbsp; See, I kneel to you to save yourself and me.'</p>

<p>There were hot tears dropping from Berenger's eyes as he caught
Diane's hand, and held it forcibly to prevent her thus abasing
herself.&nbsp; Her wild words and gestures thrilled him in every
pulse and wrung his heart, and it was with a stifled, agitated
voice that he said--</p>

<p>'God help you and me both, Diane!&nbsp; To do what you ask
would--would be no saving of either.&nbsp; Nay, if you will kneel,'
as she struggled with him, 'let it be to Him who alone can bring us
through;' and releasing her hand, he dropped on his knees by her
side, and covered his face with his hands, in an earnest
supplication that the spirit of resistance which he almost felt
slipping from him might be renewed.&nbsp; The action hushed and
silenced her, and as he rose he spoke no other word, but silently
drew back so much of the curtain that he could see into the hall,
where the dead man still lay uncoffined upon the bed where his own
hands had laid him, and the low, sweet requiem of kneeling priests
floated round him.&nbsp; Rest, rest, and calm they breathed into
one sorely tried living soul, and the perturbed heart was quelled
by the sense how short the passage was to the world where captivity
and longing would be ended.&nbsp; He beckoned to Pere Bonami to
return to Diane, and then, protected by his presence from any
further demonstrations, kissed her hand and left her.</p>

<p>He told Philip as little as possible of this interview, but his
brother remarked how much time he spent over the Psalms that
evening.</p>

<p>The next day the brothers saw from their upper winder the
arrival of Narcisse, or, as he had called himself for the last
three years, the Marquis de Nid-de-Merle, with many attendant
gentlemen, and a band of fifty or sixty gendarmes. The court was
filled with their horses, and rang with their calls for
refreshment.&nbsp; And the captives judged it wise to remain in
their upper room incase they should be called for.</p>

<p>They were proved to have been wise in so doing; for about an
hour after their arrival there was a great clanging of steel boots,
and Narcisse de Ribaumont, followed by a portly, heavily-armed
gentleman, wearing a scarf of office, by two of the servants, and
by two gendarmes, entered the room.&nbsp; It was the first time the
cousins had met since <i>le baiser d'Eustacie</i> had been hissed
into Berenger's ear.&nbsp; Narcisse looked older, sallower, and
more worn than at that time; and Philip, seeing his enemy for the
first time, contrasted him with the stately presence of Berenger,
and felt as if a rat were strangling a noble steed.</p>

<p>Each young man punctiliously removed his hat, and Nid-de-Merle,
without deigning further salutation, addressed his companion.&nbsp;
'Sir, you are here on the part of the King, and to you I deliver up
these prisoners, who, having been detained here on a charge of
carrying on a treasonable correspondence, and protected by my
father out of consideration for the family, have requited his
goodness by an attempt to strangle him, which has caused his
death.'</p>

<p>Philip actually made a leap of indignation; Berenger, better
prepared, said to the officer, 'Sir, I am happy to be placed in
charged of a King's servant, who will no doubt see justice done,
and shelter us from the private malice that could alone devise so
monstrous an accusation.&nbsp; We are ready to clear ourselves upon
oath over the corpse, and all the household and our own guards can
bear witness.'</p>

<p>'The witnesses are here,' said Narcisse, pointing to the
servants, ill-looking men, who immediately began to depose to
having found their master purple-faced and struggling in the hands
of the two young men, who had been left alone with him after
dinner.</p>

<p>Berenger felt that there was little use in self-defence.&nbsp;
It was a fabrication the more easily to secure his cousin's purpose
of destroying him, and his best hope lay in passing into the hands
of persons who were less directly interested in his ruin.&nbsp; He
drew himself up to his full height, saying, 'If there be justice in
France, our innocence will be proved.&nbsp; I demand, sir, that you
examine the abbess, the priest, the steward, the sergeant of
gendarmes: they are impartial witnesses, and will serve the King's
justice, if justice be his purpose.&nbsp; Or, if this be but M. de
Nid-de-Merle's way of completing the work he left unfinished four
years ago, I am ready.&nbsp; Only let my brother go free.&nbsp; He
is heir to nothing here.'</p>

<p>'Enough, sir.&nbsp; Words against the King's justice will be
reckoned against you,' said the officer.&nbsp; 'I shall do myself
the honour of attending the funeral the day after to-morrow, and
then I shall convey you to Tours, to answer for this deed at your
leisure.&nbsp; Monsieur le Marquis, are the prisoners secure here,
or would you have them <i>garde a vue</i>.'</p>

<p>'No need for that,' said Narcisse, lightly; 'had there been any
exit they would have found it long ago.&nbsp; Your good fellows
outside the door keep them safe enough.&nbsp; M. le Baron de
Ribaumont, I have the honour to wish you a good morning.'</p>

<p>Berenger returned his bow with one full of defiance, and the
door was again locked upon the prisoners; while Philip exclaimed,
'The cowardly villain, Berry; is it a hanging matter?'</p>

<p>'Not for noble blood,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'We are more likely
to be brought to no trial, but to lie prisoners for life;' then, as
Philip grew white and shivered with a sick horror, he added
bravely, 'But they shall not have us, Philip.&nbsp; We know the
vaults well enough to play at hide and seek with them there, and
even if we find no egress we may hold out till they think us fled
and leave open the doors!'</p>

<p>Philip's face lighted up again, and they did their best by way
of preparation, collecting wood for torches, and putting aside food
at their meals.&nbsp; It was a very forlorn hope, but the
occupation it caused was effectual in keeping up Philip's spirits,
and saving him from despondency.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX.&nbsp; THE PEDLAR'S PREDICTION</h3>

<p>But if ne'er so close you wall him,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the best that you may;</p>

<p>Blind Love, if so you call him,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will find out his way.--OLD SONG</p>

<p>'Too late,' muttered Berenger to himself, as he stood by the
fire in his prison-chamber.&nbsp; Humfrey and Philip were busy in
the vaults, and he was taking his turn in waiting in the
sitting-room to disarm suspicion. 'It is too late now, and I thank
God that so it is.'</p>

<p>'Do you indeed, M. le Baron?' said a low voice close beside him;
and, as he turned in haste, he beheld, at the foot of the
turret-stair, the youth Aime de Selinville, holding a dark lantern
in his hand, and veiling its light.</p>

<p>'Ha!' and he started to his feet.&nbsp; 'Whence come you?'</p>

<p>'From my Lady,' was the youth's answer.&nbsp; 'She has sent me
to ask whether you persist in what you replied to her the other
day.&nbsp; For if not, she bids me say that it is not too
late.'</p>

<p>'And if I do persevere?'</p>

<p>'Then--ah! what do I know?&nbsp; Who can tell how far malice can
go?&nbsp; And there are towers and bastilles where hope never
enters.&nbsp; Moreover, your researches underground are known.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said Berenger, the heart-sinking quelled by the effort of
resistance, 'Madame de Selinville has my answer--I must take
the&nbsp; consequences.&nbsp; Tell her, if she truly wishes me
well, the honourable way of saving us would be to let our English
friends know what has befallen us.'</p>

<p>'You forget, M. le Baron, even if she could proclaim the
dishonour of her family, interference from a foreign power might
only lead to a surer mode of removing you,' said Aime, lowering his
voice and shuddering.</p>

<p>'Even so, I should thank her.&nbsp; Then would the bitterest
pang be taken away.&nbsp; Those at our home would not deem us
faithless recreants.'</p>

<p>'Thank her!' murmured the lad in an inward voice.&nbsp; 'Very
well, sir, I will carry her your decision.&nbsp; It is your final
one.&nbsp; Disgrace, prison, death--rather than freedom, love,
wealth!'</p>

<p>'The semblance of dishonour rather than the reality!' said
Berenger, firmly.</p>

<p>The light-footed page disappeared, and in a few moments a very
different tread came up from below, and Philip appeared.</p>

<p>'What is it, Berry?&nbsp; Methought I heard a voice.'</p>

<p>'Forgive me, brother,' said Berenger, holding out his hand; 'I
have thrown away another offer.'</p>

<p>'Tush, the thing to pardon would be having accepted one.&nbsp; I
only wish they would leave us in peace!&nbsp; What was it this
time?'</p>

<p>'A messenger through young Selinville.&nbsp; Strange, to trust
her secrets to that lad.&nbsp; But hush, here he is again, much
sooner than I thought.&nbsp; What, sir, have you been with your
lady again?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' the young said, with a trembling voice, and Berenger
saw that his eyes were red with weeping; 'she bids me tell you that
she yields.&nbsp; She will save you eve while you have and despite
her!&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is only one thing---'</p>

<p>'And what is that?'</p>

<p>'You must encumber yourself with the poor Aime.&nbsp; You must
let me serve you instead of her.&nbsp; Listen, sir, it cannot be
otherwise.'&nbsp; Then with a brisker, more eager voice, he
continued: 'Monsieur knows that the family burial-place is
Bellaise?&nbsp; Well, to-morrow, at ten o'clock, all the household,
all the neighbourhood, will come and sprinkle holy water on the
bier.&nbsp; The first requiem will be sung, and then will all
repair to the convent.&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be the funeral mass,
the banquet, the dole.&nbsp; Every creature in the castle --nay, in
all the neighbourhood for twenty miles round--will be at the
convent, for the Abbess has given out that the alms are to be
double, and the bread of wheat.&nbsp; Not a soul will remain here,
save the two gendarmes on guard at that door, and the poor Aime,
whom no one will miss, even if any person could be distinguished in
their black cloaks.&nbsp; Madame la Comtesse has given him this
key, which opens a door on the upper floor of the keep, unknown to
the guards, who, for that matter, shall have a good tankard of
spiced wine to console and occupy them.&nbsp; Then is the way clear
to the castle court, which is not over looked by their window, the
horses are in the stables, and we are off,--that is if M. le Baron
will save a poor youth from the wrath of M. de Nid-de-Merle.'</p>

<p>'You are and honest fellow!' cried Philip, shaking him
vehemently by the hand.&nbsp; 'You shall go with us to England, and
we will make a brave man of you.'</p>

<p>'We shall owe you our lives,' said Berenger, warmly, 'and be
ever bound to you.&nbsp; Tell your lady that THIS is magnanimity;
that now I truly thank her as our preserver, and shall bless her
all the days of the life she gives us.&nbsp; But my servants?'</p>

<p>'Guibert is a traitor,' said Aime; 'he has been so ever since
you were at Paris. Breathe no word to him; but he, as a Catholic,
shall be invited to the funeral.&nbsp; Your stout Englishman should
by all means be with us.'</p>

<p>'My Norman also,' added Berenger,--'my dear foster-brother, who
has languished in the dungeon for three years;' and when the
explanation had been made, Aime assented, though half-unwillingly,
to the necessity, and presently quitted them to bear back their
answer to his lady.&nbsp; Philip shook his hand violently again,
patted him on the back, so as almost to take away his breath, and
bade him never fear, they would be sworn brothers to him for ever;
and then threw up his hat into the air, and was so near astonishing
the donjon walls with a British hurrah, that Berenger had to put
his hand over his mouth and strangle the shout in his very
throat.</p>

<p>The chief of that night was spent in enlarging the hole in
Osbert's wall, so as to admit of his creeping through it; and they
also prepared their small baggage for departure.&nbsp; Their stock
of money, though some had been spent on renewing their clothes, and
some in needful gratuities to the servants and gendarmes, was
sufficient for present needs, and they intended to wear their
ordinary dress.&nbsp; They were unlikely to meet any of the
peasants in the neighbourhood; and, indeed, Berenger had so
constantly ridden out in his black mask, that its absence, now that
his scars were gone, was as complete a change as could be effected
in one whose height was of unusual.</p>

<p>'There begins the kneel,' said Philip, standing at the
window.&nbsp; 'It's our joy-bell, Berry!&nbsp; Every clang seems to
me to say, "Home!&nbsp; home! home!"</p>

<p>'For you, Phil,' said Berenger; 'but I must be satisfied of
Eustacie's fate first.&nbsp; I shall go first to Nissard--whither
we were bound when we were seized--then to La Rochelle, whence you
may---'</p>

<p>'No more of that,' burst out Philip.&nbsp; 'What! would you have
me leave you now, after all we have gone through together?&nbsp;
Not that you will find her.&nbsp; I don't want to vex you, brother,
on such a day as this, but you conjurer's words are coming true in
the other matter.'</p>

<p>'How?&nbsp; What mean you, Phil?'</p>

<p>'What's the meaning of Aime?' asked Philip.&nbsp; 'Even I am
French scholar enough for that.&nbsp; And who sends him?'</p>

<p>Meantime the court was already filling with swarms of persons of
every rank and degree, but several anxious hours had passed before
the procession was marshalled; and friars and monks, black, white,
and gray,--priests in rich robes and tall caps,--black-cloaked
gentlemen and men-at-arms,--all bearing huge wax tapers,--and
peasants and beggars of every conceivable aspect,--filed out of the
court, bearing with them the richly-emblazoned bier of the noble
and puissant knight, the Beausire Charles Eutache de Ribaumont
Nid-de-Merle, his son walking behind in a long black mantle, and
all who counted kindred of friendship following two and two; then
all the servants, every one who properly belonged to the castle,
were counted out by the brothers from their windows, and Guibert
among them.</p>

<p>'Messieurs,' a low, anxious voice sounded in the room.</p>

<p>'We will only fetch Osbert.'</p>

<p>It was a terrible only, as precious moments slipped away before
there appeared in the lower chamber Berenger and Humfrey, dragging
between them a squalid wretch, with a skin like stained parchment
over a skeleton, tangled hair and beard, staring bewildered eyes,
and fragments of garments, all dust, dirt, and rags.</p>

<p>'Leave me, leave me, dear master,' said the object, stretching
his whole person towards the fire as they let him sink down before
it.&nbsp; 'You would but ruin yourself.'</p>

<p>'It is madness to take him,' said Aime, impatiently.</p>

<p>'I go not without him,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'Give me the soup,
Philip.'</p>

<p>Some soup and wine had been placed by the fire, and likewise a
shirt and a suit of Humfrey's clothes were spread before it.&nbsp;
Aime burst out into the yard, absolutely weeping with impatience,
when, unheeding all his remonstrances, his three companions applied
themselves to feeding, rubbing, and warming Osbert, and assuring
him that the pains in his limbs would pass away with warmth and
exercise.&nbsp; He had been valiant of heart in his dungeon; but
his sudden plunge into upper air was like rising from the grave,
and brought on all the effects of his dreary captivity, of which he
had hardly been sensible when he had first listened to the voice of
hope.</p>

<p>Dazzled, crippled, helpless, it seemed almost impossible that he
should share the flight, but Berenger remained resolute; and when
Aime returned from his fourth frantic promenade, he was told that
all was ready.</p>

<p>But for the strength of Berenger and Humfrey the poor fellow
could never have been carried up and up, nearly to the top of the
keep, then along a narrow gallery, then down again even to the
castle hall, now empty, though with the candle-sticks still around
where the bier had been.&nbsp; Aime knelt for a moment where the
head had been, hiding his face; Osbert rested in a chair; and
Philip looked wistfully up at his own sword hung over the
chimney.</p>

<p>'Resume your swords, Messieurs,' said Aime, observing him;
'Madame desires it; and take pistols also.'</p>

<p>They gladly obeyed; and when, after this short delay, they
proceeded, Osbert moved somewhat less painfully, but when they
arrived at the stable only four horses stood there.</p>

<p>'Ah! this miserable!' cried Aime, passionately, 'he ruins all my
arrangements.'</p>

<p>'Leave me,' again entreated Landry.&nbsp; 'Once outside, I can
act the beggar and cripple, and get back to Normandy.'</p>

<p>'Better leave me,' said Humfrey; 'they cannot keep me when you
are out of their clutches.'</p>

<p>'Help me, Humfrey,' said Berenger, beginning to lift his
foster-brother to the saddle, but there the poor man wavered, cried
out that his head swam, and he could not keep his seat, entreating
almost in agony to be taken down.</p>

<p>'Lean on me,' said Berenger, putting his arms round him.&nbsp;
'There!&nbsp; you will be able to get to the Grange du Temple,
where you will be in safe shelter.'</p>

<p>'Sir, sir,' cried Aime, ready to tear his hair, 'this is
ruin!&nbsp; My lady meant you to make all speed to La Rochelle and
there embark, and this is the contrary way!'</p>

<p>'That cannot be helped,' said Berenger; 'it is the only safe
place for my foster-brother.'</p>

<p>Aime, with childish petulance, muttered something about
ingratitude in crossing his lady's plans; but, as no one attended
to him, he proceeded to unfasten his horse, and then exclaimed,
half crying, 'Will no one help me?'</p>

<p>'Not able to saddle a horse! a pretty fellow for a cavalier!'
exclaimed Philip, assisting, however, and in a few minutes they
were all issuing from a low side gate, and looking back with
bounding hearts at the drooping banner on the keep of
Nid-de-Merle.</p>

<p>Only young Aime went with bowed head and drooping look, as
though pouting, and Berenger, putting Osbert's bridle into
Humfrey's hand, stepped up to him, saying, 'Hark you, M. de
Selinville, I am sorry if we seemed to neglect you.&nbsp; We owe
you and your lady all gratitude, but I must be the judge of my own
duty, and you can only be with me if you conform.'</p>

<p>The young seemed to be devouring his tears, but only said, 'I
was vexed to see my lady's plan marred, and your chance thrown
away.'</p>

<p>'Of that I must judge,' said Berenger.</p>

<p>They were in a by-lane, perfectly solitary.&nbsp; The whole
country was at the funeral.&nbsp; Through the frosty air there came
an occasional hum or murmur from Berenger, or the tinkle of a
cow-bell in the fields, but no human being was visible.&nbsp; It
was certain, however, that the Rotrous, being Huguenots, and no
vassals of Nid-de-Merle, would not be at the obsequies; and
Berenger, walking with swift strides, supporting Osbert on his
horse, continued to cheer him with promises of rest and relief
there, and listened to no entreaties from Philip or Humfrey to take
one of their horses.&nbsp; Had not Osbert borne him on his
shoulders through the butchery at Paris, and endured three years of
dungeon for his sake?</p>

<p>As for Philip, the slow pace of their ride was all insufficient
for his glee.&nbsp; He made his horse caracole at every level
space, till Berenger reminded him that they might have far to ride
that night, and even then he was constantly breaking into attempts
at shouting and whistling as often repressed, and springing up in
his stirrups to look over the high hedges.</p>

<p>The Grange was so well concealed in its wooded ravine, that only
when close upon the gate the party became aware that this
farm-yard, usually so solitary, formed an exception to the general
desertion of the country.&nbsp; There was a jingle and a stamp of
horses in the court, which could hardly be daylight echoes of the
Templars. &nbsp;Berenger feared that the Guisards might have
descended Rotrou, and was stepping forward to reconnoiter, while
young De Selinville, trembling, besought him not to run into
danger, but to turn and hasten to La Rochelle.&nbsp; By this time,
however, the party had been espied by two soldiers stationed at the
gate, but not before Berenger had had time to remark that they did
not wear either the gold <i>fleur-de-lys</i> like his late guards,
or the white cross of Lorraine; nor had they the strange air of gay
ferocity usual with the King's mercenaries.&nbsp; And almost by
instincts, at a venture, he made the old Huguenot sign he had
learnt form his father, and answered, 'For God and the
Religion.'</p>

<p>The countersign was returned.&nbsp; 'Bearn and Bourbon is the
word to-day, comrade,' replied the sentinel.&nbsp; <i>'Eh quoi!</i>
have you had an encounter, that you bring a wounded man?'</p>

<p>'Not wounded, but nearly dead in a Guisard prison,' said
Berenger, with an unspeakable sense of relief and security, as the
sentries admitted them into the large walled court, where horses
were eating hay, being watered and rubbed down; soldiers snatching
a hasty meal in corners; gentlemen in clanking breastplates coming
in and out of the house, evidently taking orders from a young man
in a gray and silver suit, whose brown eagle face, thin cheeks,
arched nose, and black eyes of keenest fire, struck Berenger at
once with a sense of recognition as well as of being under a glance
that seemed to search out everybody and everything at once.</p>

<p>'More friends!' and the tone again recalled a flood of
recollections.&nbsp; 'I thank and welcome you.&nbsp; What!&nbsp;
You have met the enemy--where is he?'</p>

<p>'My servant is not wounded.&nbsp; Sire,' said Berenger, removing
his hat and bending low.&nbsp; 'This is the effect of long
captivity.&nbsp; We have but just escaped.'</p>

<p>'Then we are the same case!&nbsp; Pardon me, sir, I have seen
you before, but for once I am at fault.'</p>

<p>'When I call myself De Ribaumont, your Grace will not
wonder.'</p>

<p>'The dead alive!&nbsp; If I mistake not, it was in the Inferno
itself that we last met!&nbsp; But we have broken through the gates
at last!&nbsp; I remember poor King Charles was delighted to hear
that you lived!&nbsp;</p>

<p>But where have you been a captive?'</p>

<p>'At Nid-de-Merle, Sire; my kinsmen accused me of treason in
order to hinder my search for my wife.&nbsp; We escaped even now
during the funeral of the Chevalier.'</p>

<p>'By favour of which we are making our way to Parthenay
unsuspected, though, by my faith, we gather so like a snowball,
that we could be a match for a few hundreds of Guisards.&nbsp; Who
is with you, M. de Ribaumont?'</p>

<p>'Let me present to your Majesty my English brother, Philip
Thistlewood,' said Berenger, drawing the lad forward, making due
obeisance, though entirely ignorant who was the plainly-dressed,
travel-soiled stranger, so evidently a born lord of men.</p>

<p>'An Englishman is ever welcome,' was his gracious reception.</p>

<p>'And,' added Berenger, 'let me also present the young De
Selinville, to whom I owe my escape.&nbsp; Where is he,
Philip?'</p>

<p>He seemed to be busy with the horses, and Berenger could not
catch his eye.</p>

<p>'Selinville!&nbsp; I thought that good Huguenot house was
extinct.'</p>

<p>'This is a relation of the late Count de Selinville, my cousin's
husband, Sire.&nbsp;&nbsp; He arranged my evasion, and would be in
danger at Nid-de-Merle.&nbsp; Call him, Philip.'</p>

<p>Before this was done, however, the King's attention was
otherwise claimed, and turning to one of his gentlemen he said,
'Here, d'Augigne, I present to you an acquaintance made in
Tartarus.&nbsp; See to his entertainment ere we start for
Parthenay.'</p>

<p>Agrippa d'Aubigne, still young, but grave and serious-looking
greeted M. de Ribaumont as men meet in hours when common interests
make rapid friendships; and from him Berenger learnt, in a few
words, that the King of Navarre's eyes had been opened at last to
the treachery of the court, and his own dishonourable
bondage.&nbsp; During a feverish attack, one night when D'Aubigne
and D'Armagnac were sitting up with him, his resolution was taken;
and on the first hunting day after his recovery, he, with these
two, the Baron de Rosny and about thirty more of his suite, had
galloped away, and had joined the Monsieur and the Prince of Conde
at Alencon.&nbsp; He had abjured the Catholic faith, declared that
nothing except ropes should bring him back to Paris, and that he
left there the mass and his wife--the first he could dispense with,
the last he meant to have; and he was now on his way to Parthenay
to meet his sister, whom he had sent Rosny to demand.&nbsp; By the
time Berenger had heard this, he had succeeded in finding honest
Rotrou, who was in a state of great triumph, and readily undertook
to give Osbert shelter, and as soon as he should have recovered to
send him to head-quarters with some young men who he knew would
take the field as soon as they learnt that the King of Navarre had
set up his standard.&nbsp; Even the inroads made into the good
farmer's stores did not abate his satisfaction in entertaining the
prime hope of the Huguenot cause; but Berenger advanced as large a
sum as he durst out of his purse, under pretext of the maintenance
of Osbert during his stay at the Grange.&nbsp; He examined Rotrou
upon his subsequent knowledge of Isaac Gardon and Eutacie, but
nothing had been heard of them since their departure, now nearly
three years back, except a dim rumour that they had been seen at
the Synod of Montauban.</p>

<p>'Well, my friend,' said Philip, when about to remount, 'this
will do rather better than a headlong gallop to Rochelle with
Nid-de-Merle at our heels.'</p>

<p>'If M. le Baron is safe, it is well,' said Aime shortly.</p>

<p>'Is Selinville there?' said Berenger, coming up.&nbsp; 'Here,
let me take you to the King of Navarre: he knew your family in
Languedoc.'</p>

<p>'No, no,' petulantly returned the boy.&nbsp; 'What am I that he
should notice me?&nbsp; It is M. de Ribaumont whom I follow, not
him or his cause.'</p>

<p>'Boy,' said Berenger, dismayed, 'remember, I have answered for
you.'</p>

<p>'I am no traitor,' proudly answered the strange boy, and
Berenger was forced to be thus satisfied, though intending to watch
him closely.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XL.&nbsp; THE SANDS OF OLONNE</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it the dew of night</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That on her glowing cheek</p>

<p>Shines in the moonbeam?--Oh, she weeps, she weeps,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the good angel that abandoned her</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At her hell baptism, by her tears drawn
down</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumes his charge...and the hope</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of pardon and
salvation rose</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As now she
understood</p>

<p>Thy lying prophecy of truth.--SOUTHEY</p>

<p>'M. de Ribaumont,' said Henry of Navarre, as he stood before the
fire after supper at Parthenay, 'I have been thinking what
commission I could give you proportioned to your rank and
influence.'</p>

<p>'Thanks to your Grace, that inquiry is soon answered.&nbsp; I am
a beggar here.&nbsp; Even my paternal estate in Normandy is in the
hands of my cousin.'</p>

<p>'You have wrongs,' said Henry, 'and wrongs are sometimes better
than possessions in a party like ours.'</p>

<p>Berenger seized the opening to explain his position, and mention
that his only present desire was for permission, in the first
place, to send a letter to England by the messenger whom the King
was dispatching to Elisabeth, in tolerable security of her secret
countenance; and, secondly, to ride to Nissard to examine into the
story he had previously heeded so little, of the old man and his
daughter rescued from the waves the day before La Sablerie was
taken.</p>

<p>'If Pluto relented, my dear Orpheus, surely Navarre may,' said
Henry good-humouredly; 'only may the priest not be more adamantine
than Minos.&nbsp; Where lies Nissard?&nbsp; On the Sable
d'Olonne?&nbsp; Then you may go thither with safety while we lie
here, and I shall wait for my sister, or for news of her.'</p>

<p>So Berenger arranged for an early start on the morrow; and young
Selinville listened with a frown, and strange look in his dark
eyes.&nbsp; 'You go not to England?' he said.</p>

<p>'Not yet?' said Berenger</p>

<p>'This was not what my Lady expected,' he muttered; but though
Berenger silenced him by a stern look, he took the first
opportunity of asking Philip if it would not be far wiser for his
brother to place himself in safety in England.</p>

<p>'Wiser, but less honest,' said Philip.</p>

<p>'He who has lost all here, who has incurred his grandfather's
anger,' pursued Aime, 'were he not wiser to make his peace with his
friends in England?'</p>

<p>'His friends in England would not like him the better for
deserting his poor wife's cause,' said Philip.&nbsp; 'I advise you
to hold your tongue, and not meddle or make.'</p>

<p>Aime subsided, and Philip detected something like tears.&nbsp;
He had still much of rude English boyhood about him, and he laughed
roughly.&nbsp; 'A fine fellow, to weep at a word!&nbsp; Hie thee
back to feed my Lady's lap-dog, 'tis all thou art fit for.'</p>

<p>'There spoke English gratitude,' said Aime, with a toss of the
head and flash of the eye.</p>

<p>Philip despised him the more for casting up his obligations, but
had no retort to make.&nbsp; He had an idea of making a man of
young Selinville, and his notion of the process had something of
the bullying tendency of English young towards the poor-spirited or
cowardly.&nbsp; He ordered the boy roughly, teased him for his
ignorance of manly exercises, tried to cure his helplessness by
increasing his difficulties, and viewed his fatigue as affectation
or effeminacy.&nbsp; Berenger interfered now and then to guard the
poor boy from a horse-jest or practical joke, but he too felt that
Aime was a great incumbrance, hopelessly cowardly, fanciful, and
petulant; and he was sometimes driven to speak to him with
severity, verging on contempt, in hopes of rousing a sense of
shame.</p>

<p>The timidity, so unusual and inexplicable in a youth of eighteen
or twenty, sowed itself irrepressibly at the Sands of Olonne.&nbsp;
These were not misty, as on Berenger's former journey.&nbsp;
Nissard steeple was soon in sight, and the guide who joined them on
a rough pony had no doubt that there would be ample time to cross
before high water.&nbsp; There was, however, some delay, for the
winter rains had brought down a good many streams of fresh water,
and the sands were heavy and wet, so that their horses proceeded
slowly, and the rush and dash of the waves proclaimed that the low
of the tide had begun.&nbsp; To the two brothers the break and
sweep was a home-sound, speaking of freshness and freedom, and the
salt breeze and spray carried with them life and ecstasy.&nbsp;
Philip kept as near the incoming waves as his inland-bred horse
would endure, and sang, shouted, and hallooed to them as welcome as
English waves; but Aime de Selinville had never even beheld the sea
before: and even when the tide was still in the distance, was
filled with nervous terror as each rushing fall sounded nearer;
and, when the line of white foamy crests became more plainly
visible, he was impelled to hurry on towards the steeple so fast
that the guide shouted to him that he would only bury himself in a
quicksand.</p>

<p>'But,' said he, white with alarm, and his teeth chattering, 'how
can we creep with those dreadful waves advancing upon us to drown
us?'</p>

<p>Berenger silence Philip's rude laugh and was beginning to
explain that the speed of the waves could always be calculated by
an experienced inhabitant; and his voice had seemed to pacify Aime
a little, when the spreading water in front of a broken wave
flowing up to his horse's feet, again rendered him nearly
frantic.&nbsp; 'Let us go back!' he wildly entreated, turning his
horse; but Berenger caught his bridle, saying, 'That would be truly
death.&nbsp; Boy, unless you would be scorned, restrain your
folly.&nbsp; Nothing else imperils us.'</p>

<p>Here, however, the guide interposed, saying that it had become
too late to pursue their course along the curve of the shore, but
they must at once cut straight across, which he had intended to
avoid, because of the greater depth of a small river that they
would have to cross, which divided further out into small channels,
more easily forded.&nbsp; They thus went along the chord of the arc
formed by the shore, and Aime was somewhat reassured, as the sea
was at first farther off; but before long they reached the stream,
which lost itself in many little channels in the sands, so that
when the tide was out there was a perfect network of little streams
dividing low shingly or grassy isles, but at nearly high tide, as
at present, many of these islets were submerged, and the strife
between river and sea caused sudden deepenings of the water in the
channels.</p>

<p>The guide eagerly explained that the safest place for crossing
was not by the large sandbank furthest inland and looking firm and
promising--it was a recent shifting performance of the water's
heaping up, and would certainly sink away and bury horse the
channels on either side had shingly bottoms, and were
safe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>'This way,' called Berenger, himself setting the example, and
finding no difficulty; the water did not rise above his boots, and
the current was not strong.&nbsp; He had reached the shingly isle
when he looked round for his companions; Humfrey and Philip were
close behind him; but, in spite of the loud '<i>gare</i>!' of the
guide, Aime, or his horse,--for each was equally senseless with
alarm,--were making inwards; the horse was trying to tread on the
sandbank, which gave way like the water itself, under its frantic
struggles-- there was a loud cry--a shrill, unmistakable woman's
shriek--the horse was sinking--a white face and helpless form were
being carried out on the waves, but not before Berenger had flung
himself from his horse, thrown off his cloak and sword, and dashed
into the water; and in the lapse of a few moments he struggled back
to the island, where were Philip and Humfrey, leg-deep in water:
the one received his burthen, the other helped him to land.</p>

<p>'On, gentlemen, not a moment to lose,' cried the guide; and
Berenger, still panting, flung himself on his horse, held out his
arms, gathered the small, almost inanimate figure upon the horse's
neck before him, and in a few minutes more they had crossed the
perilous passage, and were on a higher bank where they could safely
halt; and Philip, as he came to help his brother, exclaimed, 'What
a fool the boy is!'</p>

<p>'Hush!' said Berenger, gravely, as they laid the figure on the
ground.</p>

<p>'What!&nbsp; he can't have been drowned in that moment.&nbsp;
We'll bring him to.'</p>

<p>'Hands off!' said Berenger, kneeling over the gasping form, and
adding in a lower voice, 'Don't you see?'&nbsp; He would his hand
in the long drenched hair, and held it up, with cheeks burning like
fire, and his scar purple.</p>

<p>'A woman!--what?--who?'&nbsp; Then suddenly divining, he
exclaimed, 'The jade!' and started with wide eyes.</p>

<p>'Stand back,' said Berenger; 'she is coming to herself.'</p>

<p>Perhaps she had been more herself than he knew, for, as he
supported her head, her hand stole over his and held it fast.&nbsp;
Full of consternation, perplexity, and anger as he was, he could
not but feel a softening pity towards a creature so devoted, so
entirely at his mercy.&nbsp; At the moment when she lay helpless
against him, gasps heaving her breast under her manly doublet, her
damp hair spread on his knees, her dark eyes in their languor
raised imploring his face, her cold hand grasping his, he felt as
if this great love were a reality, and as if he were hunting a
shadow; and, as if fate would have it so, he must save and gratify
one whose affection must conquer his, who was so tender, so
beautiful--even native generosity seemed on her side.&nbsp; But in
the midst, as in his perplexity he looked up over the gray sea, he
seemed to see the picture so often present to his mind of the pale,
resolute girl, clasping her babe to her breast, fearless of the
advancing sea, because true and faithful. And at that thought faith
and prayer rallied once again round his heart, shame at the
instant's wavering again dyed his cheek; he recalled himself, and
speaking the more coldly and gravely because his heart was beating
over hotly, he said,&nbsp; 'Cousin, you are better.&nbsp; It is but
a little way to Nissard.'</p>

<p>'Why have you saved me, if you will not pity me?' she
murmured.</p>

<p>'I will not pity, because I respect my kinswoman who has save
our lives,' he said steadying his voice with difficulty.&nbsp; 'The
priests of Nissard will aid me in sparing your name and fame.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' she cried, sitting up with a start of joy, 'but he would
make too many inquiries!&nbsp; Take me to England first.'</p>

<p>Berenger started as he saw how he had been misunderstood.</p>

<p>'Neither here nor in England could my marriage be set aside,
cousin. No; not priest shall take charge of you, and place you in
safety and honour.'</p>

<p>'He shall not!' she cried hotly.&nbsp; 'Why--why will you drive
me from you--me who ask only to follow you as a menial
servant?'</p>

<p>'That has become impossible,' he answered; 'to say nothing of my
brother, my servant and the guide have seen;' and, as she
remembered her streaming hair, and tried, in dawning confusion, to
gather it together, he continued: 'You shrank from the eye of the
King of Navarre.&nbsp; You cannot continue as you have done; you
have not even strength.'</p>

<p>'Ah! have you sailed for England,' she murmured.</p>

<p>'It had only been greater shame,' he said.&nbsp; 'Cousin, I am
head of your family, husband of your kinswoman, and bound to
respect the reputation you have risked for me.&nbsp; I shall,
therefore, place you in charge of the priest till you can either
return to your aunt or to some other convent.&nbsp; You can ride
now.&nbsp; We will not wait longer in these wet garments.'</p>

<p>He raised her from the ground, threw his own dry cloak round her
shoulders and unmanageable hair, and lifted her on his horse; but,
as she would have leant against him, he drew himself away, beckoned
Philip, and put the bridle into his hands, saying, 'Take care of
her.&nbsp; I shall ride on and warm the priest.'</p>

<p>'The rock of diamond,' she murmured, not aware that the diamond
had been almost melting.&nbsp; That youthful gravity and
resolution, with the mixture of respect and protection, imposed as
usual upon her passionate nature, and daunted her into meekly
riding beside Philip without a word--only now and then he heard a
low moan, and knew that she was weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>At first the lad had been shocked beyond measure, and would have
held aloof as from a kind of monster, but Madame de Selinville had
been the first woman to touch his fancy, and when he heard how
piteously she was weeping, and recollected where he should have
been but for her, as well as all his own harshness to her as a
cowardly boy, he felt himself brutally ungrateful, and spoke:</p>

<p>'Don't weep so, Madame; I am sorry I was rude to you, but you
see, how should I take you for a woman?'</p>

<p>Perhaps she heard, but she heeded not.</p>

<p>'My brother will take good care to shield you,' Philip
added.&nbsp; 'He will take care you are safe in one of your
nunneries;' and as she only wept the more, he added, with a sudden
thought, 'You would not go there; you would embrace the Protestant
faith?'</p>

<p>'I would embrace whatever was his.'</p>

<p>Philip muttered something about seeing what could be done.&nbsp;
They were already at the entrance of the village, and Berenger had
come out to meet them, and, springing towards him, Philip
exclaimed, in a low voice, 'Berry, she would abjure her Popish
errors!&nbsp; You can't give her up to a priest.'</p>

<p>'Foolery, Philip,' answered Berenger, sternly.</p>

<p>'If she would be a convert!'</p>

<p>'Let her be a modest woman first;' and Berenger, taking her
bridle, led her to the priest's house.</p>

<p>He found that Pere Colombeau was preaching a Lent sermon, and
that nobody was at home but the housekeeper, to whom he had
explained briefly that the lady with him had been forced to escape
in disguise, had been nearly drowned, and was in need of
refreshment and female clothing.&nbsp; Jacinthe did not like the
sound, but drenched clothes were such a passport to her master's
house, that she durst not refuse.&nbsp; Berenger carried off his
other companions to the cabaret, and when he had dried himself,
went to wait for the priest at the church door, sitting in the
porch where more than one echo of the exhortation to repentance and
purity rang in his ears, and enforced his conviction that here he
must be cruel if he would be merciful.</p>

<p>It was long before Pere Colombeau came out, and then, if the
scar had not blushed for all the rest of his face, the sickly,
lanky lad of three years since would hardly have been recognized to
the good cure.&nbsp; But the priest's aspect was less benignant
when Berenger tried to set before him his predicament; he coldly
asked where the unhappy lady was; and when Berenger expressed his
intention of coming the next morning to ask his counsel, he only
bowed.&nbsp; He did not ask the brothers to supper, nor show any
civility; and Berenger, as he walked back to the cabaret, perceived
that his story was but half believed, and that, if Diane's passion
were still stronger than her truth or generosity, she would be able
to make out a terrible case against him, and to willing ears,
naturally disposed against a young cavalier and a heretic.</p>

<p>He sat much dispirited by the fire of the little wine shop,
thinking that his forbearance had been well-nigh thrown away, and
that his character would never be cleared in Eustacie's eyes,
attaching, indeed, more importance to the blot than would have been
done by a youth less carefully reared.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when a knock came to the door: the cure's
white head appeared in the lamplight; he nodded kindly to all the
guests, and entreated that M. de Ribaumont would do him a favour to
come and speak with him.</p>

<p>No sooner were they outside the house, than the cure held out
his hand, saying 'Sir, forgive me for a grievous injustice towards
you;' then pressing his hand, he added with a voice tremulous with
emotion, 'Sir, it is no slight thing to have saved a wandering
sheep by your uprightness and loyalty.'</p>

<p>'Have you then opened her eyes, father?' said Berenger, relieved
from a heavy load.</p>

<p>'You have, my son,' said the old man.&nbsp; 'You have taught her
what truth and virtue are.&nbsp; For the rest, you shall heard for
yourself.'</p>

<p>Before Berenger knew where he was, a door was opened, and he
found himself in the church.&nbsp; The building was almost entirely
dark; there were two tall lights at the altar in distance, and a
few little slender tapers burning before certain niches and
shrines, but without power to conquer with the gloom more than
enough to spread a pale circle of yellow light beneath them, and to
show mysteriously a bit of vaulting above.&nbsp; A single lamp hung
from an arch near the door, and beneath it, near a pillar, knelt,
or rather crouched, on the floor, a female figure with a dark
peasant cloak drawn over her head.</p>

<p>'The first token of penitence is reparation to the injured,'
said the priest.</p>

<p>Berenger looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>'I will not leave you,' he added.&nbsp; 'See, I shall pray for
you yonder, by the altar,' and he slowly moved up the aisle.</p>

<p>'Rise, cousin, I entreat you,' said Berenger, much embarrassed,
as he disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>'I must speak thus,' she answered, in a hoarse, exhausted
voice.&nbsp; 'Ah! pardon, pardon!' she added, rising, however, so
far as to raise clasped hands and an imploring face.&nbsp; 'Ah! can
you pardon?&nbsp; It was through me that you bear those wounds;
that she--Eustacie-- was forced into the masque, to detain you for
THAT night.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; pardon.'</p>

<p>'That is long past,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'I have been too near
death not to have pardoned that long ago.&nbsp; Rise, cousin, I
cannot see you thus.'</p>

<p>'That is not all,' continued Diane.&nbsp; 'It was I--I who moved
my father to imprison you.'&nbsp; Then, as he bent his head, and
would have again entreated her to rise, she held out her hand as if
to silence him, and spoke faster, more wildly.&nbsp; 'Then--then I
thought it would save your life.&nbsp; I thought---' she looked at
him strangely with her great dark eyes, all hollow and cavernous in
her white face.</p>

<p>'I know,' said Berenger, kindly, 'you often urged it on me.'</p>

<p>There was a sort of movement on the part of the kneeling figure
of the priest at the altar, and she interrupted, saying
precipitately.&nbsp; 'Then--then, I did think you free.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' he gasped.&nbsp; 'Now---!'</p>

<p>'Now I know that she lives!' and Diane once more sank at his
feet a trembling, shrinking, annihilated heap of shame and
misery.</p>

<p>Berenger absolutely gave a cry that, though instantly repressed,
had the ring of ecstasy in it.&nbsp; 'Cousin--cousin!' he cried,
'all is forgiven--all forgotten, if you will only tell me
where!'</p>

<p>'That I cannot,' said Diane, rousing herself again, but speaking
in a dull, indifferent tone, as of one to whom the prime bitterness
was past, 'save that she is under the care of the Duchess de
Quinet;' and she then proceeded, as though repeating a lesson: 'You
remember the Italian conjurer whom you would not consult?&nbsp;
Would that I had not!' she added, clasping her hands.&nbsp; 'His
prediction lured me?&nbsp; Well, he saw my father privately, told
him he had seen her, and had bought her jewels, even her
hair.&nbsp; My father sent him in quest of her again, but told not
me till the man returned with tidings that she was at Quinet, in
favour with the Duchess.&nbsp; You remember that he went from
home.&nbsp; It was to demand he; and, ah! you know how long I had
loved you, and they told me that your marriage was void, and that
all would be well upon the dispensation coming.&nbsp; And now the
good father there tells me that I was deceived--cruelly
deceived--that such a dispensation would not be granted save
through gross misrepresentation.'&nbsp; Then, as Berenger began to
show tokens of eagerness to come at tidings of Eustacie, she
continued, 'Ah! it is vain to seek to excuse one you care not
for.&nbsp; My father could learn nothing from the Duchess; she
avowed that she had been there, but would say no more.&nbsp;
However, he and my brother were sure she was under their
protection; they took measures, and--and the morning my poor father
was stricken, there had been a letter from my brother to say he was
on her track, and matters must be ended with you, for he should
have her in a week;' and then, as Berenger started forward with an
inarticulate outburst, half of horror, half of interrogation, she
added, 'Where, he said not, nor did I learn from him.&nbsp; All our
one interview was spend in sneers that answered to my wild
entreaties; but this I know--that you would never have reached
Tours a living man.'</p>

<p>'And now, now he is on the way to her!' cried Berenger, 'and you
kept it from me!'</p>

<p>'There lay my hope,' said Diane, raising her head; and now, with
glittering eyes and altered voice, 'How could I not but hate her
who had bereaved me of you; her for whose sake I could not earn
your love?'</p>

<p>The change of her tone had, perhaps, warned the priest to draw
nearer, and as she perceived him, she said, 'Yes, father, this is
not the way to absolution, but my heart will burst if I say not
all.'</p>

<p>'Thou shalt not prevail, foul spirit,' said the priest, looking
earnestly into the darkness, as though he beheld the fiend hovering
over her, 'neither shall these holy walls be defiled with accents
of unhallowed love.&nbsp; You have made your reparation, daughter;
it is enough.'</p>

<p>'And can you tell me no more?' said Berenger, sadly.&nbsp; 'Can
you give me no clue that I may save her from the wolf that may be
already on her track?&nbsp; Cousin, if you would do this, I would
bless you for ever.'</p>

<p>'Alas! I would if I could!&nbsp; It is true, cousin, I have no
heart to deceive you any longer.&nbsp; But it is to Madame de
Quinet that you must apply, and if my brother has though me worth
pursuit, you may be in time!&nbsp; One moment,'--as he would have
sprung away as if in the impulse to fly to the rescue,--'cousin;
had you gone to England as I hoped, I would have striven to deserve
to win that love of yours, but you have conquered by your
constancy.&nbsp; Now, father, I have spoken my last save as
penitent.'</p>

<p>She covered her head and sank down again.</p>

<p>Berenger, bewildered and impelled to be doing something, let the
priest lead him out before he exclaimed, 'I said nothing to her of
pardon!'</p>

<p>'You do pardon?' said the priest.</p>

<p>He paused a moment.&nbsp; 'Freely, if I find my wife.&nbsp; I
can only remember now that she set me on the way.&nbsp; I would
ease her soul, poor thing, and thinking would make me hard
again.'</p>

<p>'Do the English bring up their sons with such feelings?' asked
the cure, pausing for a moment.</p>

<p>'Of course,' said Berenger.&nbsp; 'May I say that one word,
sir?'&nbsp;</p>

<p>'Not now,' said the priest; 'she had better be left to think of
her sin towards Heaven, rather than towards man.'</p>

<p>'But do you leave her there, sir?'</p>

<p>'I shall return.&nbsp; I shall pray for her true penitence,'
said the priest, and Berenger perceived from his tone that one
without the pale might inquire no further.&nbsp; He only asked how
safe and honourable shelter could be found for her; and the cure
replied that he had already spoken to her of the convent of Lucon,
and should take her there so soon as it could safely be done, and
that Abbess Monique, he trusted, would assist her crushed spirit in
finding the path of penitence.&nbsp; He thought her cousin had
better not endeavour to see her again; and Berenger himself was
ready to forget her very existence in his burning anxiety to
outstrip Narcisse in the quest of Eustacie.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLI.&nbsp; OUR LADY OF HOPE</h3>

<p>Welcome to danger's hour,</p>

<p>Brief greeting serves the time of strife.--SCOTT</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As soon as it was possible to leave Nissard, Berenger was on his
way back to head-quarters, where he hoped to meet the Duke de
Quinet among the many Huguenot gentlemen who were flocking to the
Bourbon standard; nor was he disappointed in the hope, for he was
presented to a handsome middle-aged gentleman, who told him, with
much politeness, that his mother had had the honour to receive and
entertain Mme. de Ribaumont and that some months ago he had himself
arranged for the conveyance of her letters to England, but, he
said, with a smile, he made a point of knowing nothing of his
mother's guests, lest his duties as a governor might clash with
those of hospitality.&nbsp; He offered to expedite M. de
Ribaumont's journey to Quinet, observing that, if Nid de Merle
were, indeed, on the point of seizing the lady, it must be by
treachery; indeed he had, not ten days back, had the satisfaction
of hanging an Italian mountebank who had last year stolen a whole
packet of dispatches, among them letters from Mme. de Ribaumont,
and the fellow was probably acting as a spy upon her, so that no
time was to be lost in learning from his mother where she
was.&nbsp; On the next morning he was about to send forward twenty
men to reinforce a little frontier garrison on the river Dronne,
and as M. le Baron must pass through the place, it would be
conferring a favour on him to take the command.&nbsp; The men were
all well mounted, and would not delay; and when once across the
frontier of Guyenne, no escort would be needed.</p>

<p>Berenger gladly accepted the proposal.&nbsp; It did not occur to
him that he was thus involved in the civil war, and bearing arms
against the sovereign.&nbsp; In spite of Queen Elisabeth's alliance
with the French court, she connived at her youthful subjects
seeking the bubble reputation in the mouths of Valois cannon; and
so little did Henry III. seem to Berenger to be his king, that he
never thought of the question of allegiance,--nay, if the royal
officers were truly concerned in his arrest, he was already an
outlaw.&nbsp; This was no moment for decision between Catholic and
Calvinist; all he wanted was to recover his wife and forestall her
enemies.</p>

<p>Henry of Navarre gave his full consent to the detachment being
placed under charge of M. de Ribaumont.&nbsp; He asked somewhat
significantly what had become of the young gentleman who had
attended M. de Ribaumont, and Philip blushed crimson to the ears,
while Berenger replied, with greater coolness than he had given
himself credit for, that the youth had been nearly drowned on the
Sable d'Olonne, and had been left at Dom Colombeau's to
recover.&nbsp; The sharp-witted King looked for a moment rather as
Sir Hugh the Heron did when Marmion accounted for his page's
absence, but was far too courteous and too INSOUCIANT to press the
matter further, though Berenger saw quite enough of is expression
to feel that he had been delivered from his companion only just in
time.</p>

<p>Berenger set forth as soon as his impatience could prevail to
get the men into their saddles.&nbsp; He would fain have ridden day
and night, and grudged every halt for refreshment, so as almost to
run the risk of making the men mutinous.&nbsp; Evening was coming
on, and his troop had dismounted at a cabaret, in front of which he
paced up and down with Philip, trying to devise some pretext for
hastening them on another stage before night, when a weary,
travel-stained trooper rode up to the door and was at once hailed
as a comrade by the other men, and asked, 'What cheer at Pont de
Dronne?'</p>

<p>'Bad enough,' he answered, 'unless you can make the more speed
there!'&nbsp; then making obeisance to Berenger he continued his
report, saying that Captain Falconnet was sending him to M. le Duc
with information that the Guisards were astir, and that five
hundred <i>gens d'armes</i>, under the black Nid de Merle, as it
was said, were on their way intending to surprise Pont de Dronne,
and thus cut the King of Navarre off from Guyenne and his kingdom
beyond it.&nbsp; After this Berenger had no more difficulty with
his men, who were most of them Quinet vassals, with homes south of
the Dronne, and the messenger only halted for a hasty meal,
hastening on to the Duke, that a more considerable succour might at
once be dispatched.</p>

<p>'Is she there whom they call the Lady of Hope?' asked one of the
soldiers, a mercenary, less interested than most of his comrades,
as he had only a fortnight since transferred his services from
Guise to Quinet.</p>

<p>'Our Lady of Sadness just now,' replied the messenger; 'her old
father is at the point of death.&nbsp; However, she is there, and
at our last siege twenty wine-skins would not so well have kept up
men's hearts.'</p>

<p>'And the little one, the white fairy, is she there too?&nbsp;
They say 'tis a spirit, a changeling that could not brook the
inside of a church, but flew out of the Moustier at Montauban like
a white swan, in the middle of a sermon.'</p>

<p>'I only know I've seen her sleep like a dormouse through
prayers, sermon, and all at Pont de Dronne.&nbsp; <i>Follette</i>
is she be, she belongs to the white elves of the moonlight.'</p>

<p>'Well, they say bullets won't touch her, and no place can be
taken where she is,' replied the trooper.&nbsp; 'Nay, that Italian
pedlar rogue, the same that the Duke has since hung, has sold to
long Gilles and snub-nosed&nbsp; Pierre silver bullets, wherewith
they have sworn to shoot the one or the other next time they had a
chance.'</p>

<p>These words were spoken at not great distance from Berenger, but
passed by him as mere men-at-arms' gossip, in his eagerness to
expedite the start of his party; and in less than an hour they were
<i>en route</i> for Pont de Dronne; but hasten as he would, it was
not till near noon the next day that he came in sight of a valley,
through which wound a river, crossed by a high-backed bridge, with
a tall pointed arch in the middle, and a very small one on either
side.&nbsp; An old building of red stone, looking like what it
was--a monastery converted into a fortress--stood on the nearer, or
northern bank, and on the belfry tower waved a flag with the arms
of Quinet.&nbsp; Higher up the valley, there was an ominous hum,
and clouds of smoke and dust; and the <i>gen d'armes</i>, who knew
the country, rejoiced that they were come just in time, and
exchanged anxious questions whether the enemy were not fording the
river above them, so as to attack not only the fortress on this
northern side, but the bridge tower on the southern bank of the
river.</p>

<p>Spurring down the hill, the party were admitted, at the
well-guarded gateway, into a large thickly-walled yard, where the
soldiers and horses remained, and Berenger and Philip, passing
through a small arched doorway into the body of the old monastery,
were conducted to a great wainscoted hall, where a pulpit
projecting from the wall, and some defaced emblematic ornaments,
showed that this had once been the refectory, though guard-room
appliances now occupied it.&nbsp; The man who had shown them in
left them, saying he would acquaint Captain Falconnet with their
arrival, and just then a sound of singing drew both brothers to the
window.&nbsp; It looked out on what had once been the quadrangle,
bounded on three sides by the church, the refectory, and the monk's
lodgings, the cloistered arcade running round all these.&nbsp; The
fourth side was skirted by the river, which was, however, concealed
by an embankment, raised, no doubt, to supply the place of the
wall, which had been unnecessary to the peaceful original
inhabitants.&nbsp; What attracted Berenger's eyes was, however, a
group in the cloister, consisting of a few drooping figures, some
of men in steel caps, others of veiled, shrouded women, and
strange, mingled feelings swept over him as he caught the notes of
the psalm sung over the open grave--</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Si qu'en paix et seurte bonne Coucherai et
reposerai--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car, Seigneur, ta bonte tout ordonne</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et elle seule espoir donne</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Que seur et sain regnant serai.'</p>

<p>'Listen, Philip,' he said, with moistening eyes; then as they
ended, 'It is the 4<sup>th</sup> Psalm: "I lay me down in peace and
take my rest."&nbsp; Eustacie and I used to sing it to my
father.&nbsp; It was well done in these mourners to sing it over
him whom they are laying down to take his rest while the enemy are
at the gates.&nbsp; See, the poor wife still kneels while the rest
disperse; how dejected and utterly desolate she looks.'</p>

<p>He was so intently watching her as not to perceive the entrance
of a tall, grizzled old man in a steel cap, evidently the commander
of the garrison.&nbsp; There was the brief welcome of danger's
hour--the briefer, because Captain Falconnet was extremely deaf,
and, taking it for granted that the new-comers were gentlemen of
the Duke's, proceeded to appoint them their posts without further
question.&nbsp; Berenger had intended to pursue his journey to
Quinet without delay, but the intelligence that the enemy were on
the southern as well as the northern side of the river rendered
this impossible; and besides, in defending this key of Guyenne
against Narcisse, he was also defending Eustacie.</p>

<p>The state of affairs was soon made known to him.&nbsp; The old
monastery, covering with its walls an extensive space, formed a
fortress quite strong enough to resist desultory attacks, and
protect the long bridge, which was itself strongly walled on either
side, and with a barbican at the further end.&nbsp; In former
assaults the attacks had always been on the north, the Catholic
side, as it might be called; but now the enemy had crossed the
river above the fort, and were investing the place on both
sides.&nbsp; Long foreseeing this, the old commandant had guarded
the bank of the river with the earthwork, a long mound sloped
irregularly on either hand, over which numerous little paths had
since been worn by the women within, when on their way to the river
with their washing; but he had been setting every one to work to
destroy and fill up these, so that the rampart was smooth and
slopping, perfectly easy indeed to cross, but high and broad enough
to serve as an effectual protection against such artillery as the
detached troops of the Guise party were likely to possess; and the
river was far too wide, deep, and strong in its main current to be
forded in the face of a hostile garrison.&nbsp; The captain had
about fifty <i>gen d'armes</i> in his garrison, besides the twenty
new-comers whom he persisted in regarding as Berenger's charge; and
there were, besides, some seventy peasants and silk spinners, who
had come into the place as a refuge from the enemy--and with these
he hoped to hold put till succour should come from the Duke.&nbsp;
He himself took the command of the north gate, where the former
assaults had been made, and he instructed to his new ally the tower
protecting the bridge, advising him to put on armour; but Berenger,
trying on a steel cap, found that his head could not bear the
weight and heat, and was forced to return to his broad-brimmed
Spanish hat, while Philip in high glee armed himself as best he
could with what Captain Falconnet could lend him.&nbsp; he was too
much excited to eat of the scanty meal that was set before them: a
real flight seemed like a fair-day to him, and he was greatly
exalted by his brother's post of command--a post that Berenger felt
a heavy responsibility only thrust upon him by the commandant's
incapacity of hearing how utterly inexperienced he was.</p>

<p>The formal summons to surrender to the King, and the refusal,
had duly passed, and it became evident that the first attack was to
be on the bridge-gate.&nbsp; Captain Falconnet hurried to the
place, and the fighting was hot and desperate.&nbsp; Every
assailant who tried to throw his fagot into the moat became a mark
for arquebus or pistol, and the weapons that had so lately hung
over the hearth at Nid de Merle were now aimed again and again at
the heads and corslets of Guisards, with something of the same
exulting excitement as, only higher, more engrossing, and fiercer
than, that with which the lads had taken aim at a wolf, or ridden
after a fox.&nbsp; Scaling-ladders were planted and hurled down
again; stones were cast from the battlements, crushing the enemy;
and throughout Berenger's quick eye, alert movements, and great
height and strength, made him a most valuable champion, often
applauded by a low murmur of commendation from old Falconnet, or a
loud shout of 'Ha, well done, the Duke's Englishman,' from the <i>
gen</i> <i>d'armes</i>--for English they would have him to be--on
the presumptions afforded by his companions, his complexion, and
his slow speech.&nbsp; Nor did Philip and Humfrey fail to render
good service.&nbsp; But just as the enemy had been foiled in a
sharp assault and were dragging away their wounded, Philip touched
his brother, and saying, 'I can hold out no longer,' showed blood
trickling down his right side.</p>

<p>Berenger threw an arm round him, and Captain Falconnet, seeing
his case, said, 'You are hit, <i>petit Anglais</i>; you have done
gallantly.&nbsp; There will be time for you to take him to his
quarters, sir; these fellows have had enough for the present, and
you can tarry with him till you hear the bugle.&nbsp; Whither, did
you ask?&nbsp; Let me see.&nbsp; You, Renaud, take him to the
chapel: the old chancel behind the boarding will be more private;
and desire Madame to look to him.&nbsp; Farewell!</p>

<p>I hope it may prove slight; you are a brave youth.'&nbsp; And he
shook hands with Philip, whose intense gratification sustained him
for many steps afterwards</p>

<p>He hardly remembered receiving the hurt, and was at first too
busy to heed it, or to call off any one attention, until a dread of
falling, and being trodden on, had seized him and made him speak;
and indeed he was so dizzy that Berenger with difficulty kept him
on his feet over the bridge, and in the court lifted him in his
arms and carried him almost fainting into the cloister, where by
the new-made grave still knelt the black-veiled mourner.&nbsp; She
started to her feet as the soldier spoke to her, and seemed at
first not to gather the sense of his words; but then, as if with an
effort, took them in, made one slight sound like a moan of
remonstrance at the mention of the place, but again recollecting
herself, led the way along a stone passage, into which a flight of
stairs descended into the apsidal chancel, roughly boarded off from
the rest of the church.&nbsp; It was a ruinous, desolate place, and
Berenger looked round in dismay for some place on which to lay down
his almost unconscious burthen.&nbsp; The lady bent her head and
signed towards the stone sedilia in the wall; then, after two
ineffectual essays to make her voice audible, choked as it was with
long weeping, she said, low and huskily, 'We will make him more
comfortable soon;' and added some orders to the soldier, who
disappeared up the stairway, and Berenger understood that he was
gone to fetch bedding.&nbsp; Then taking from under her heavy
mourning cloak a large pair of scissors, she signed to Berenger how
to support his brother, while they relieved him of his corslet,
sword-belt, and doublet.&nbsp; The soldier had meantime returned
with an old woman, both loaded with bedding, which she signed to
them to arrange in one of the little bays or niches that served to
form a crown of lesser chapels around the chancel.&nbsp; She flung
aside her muffling cloak, but her black hood still hung far over
her face, and every now and then hand or handkerchief was lifted as
if to clear her eyes from the tears that would not cease to gather
and blind her; and she merely spoke when some direction to an
assistant, some sympathetic word to the patient, was needed.&nbsp;
Even Philip in his dizzy trance guessed that he was succeeding to
the bed whence one much dearer had gone to his quieter rest in the
cloister.&nbsp; Before he was laid there, however, the bugle
sounded; there was a loud shout, and Philip exclaimed, 'Go,
brother!'</p>

<p>'Trust him to me, sir,' said the sunken, extinguished voice; 'we
will do our best for him.'</p>

<p>He was forced merely to lift Philip to the bed, and to hurry
away, while the soldier followed him saying, consolingly, 'Fear
not, sir, now our Lady of Hope has him.&nbsp; Nothing goes ill to
which she sets her hand.'</p>

<p>Another growl of artillery was not heard, and it was time for
the warriors to forget the wounded in the exigencies of the
present.&nbsp; An attack was made on both gates at once, and the
commandant being engaged at his own post, Berenger had to make the
utmost of his brief experience, backed by the counsel of a tough
old sergeant; and great was his sense of exhilaration, and absolute
enjoyment in this full and worthy taxing of every power of mind or
body.&nbsp; The cry among the enemy, 'Aime at the black plume,'
attested his prominence; but he black plum was still unscathed when
spring twilight fell.&nbsp; The din began to subside; recalls were
sounded by the besiegers; and Berenger heard his own exploit bawled
in the ear of the deaf commandant, who was advancing over the
bridge. The old captain complimented him, told him that he should
be well reported of to M. le Duc and Sieur la Noue, and invited him
to supper and bed in his own quarters.&nbsp; The supper Berenger
accepted, so soon as he should know how it was with his brother;
but as to bed, he intended to watch his brother, and visit his post
form time to time.</p>

<p>The captain entered by the main door of the chapel, where ten or
twelve wounded were now lying, tended by peasant women.&nbsp;
Berenger merely passed through, seeing as he went the black hood
busy over a freshly-brought-in-patient.&nbsp; He found a door which
admitted him through the rough screen of boards to the choir where
he had been in the earlier part of the day.&nbsp; The moonlight
came through the shivered eastern windows, but a canvas curtain had
been hung so as to shelter Philip's vaulted recess from the cold
draught, and the bed itself, with a chair beside it, looked neat,
clean, and comfortable. Philip himself was cheery; he said the
bullet had made a mere flesh-wound, and had passed out on the other
side, and the Lady of Hope, as they called he, was just such
another as Aunt Cecily, and had made him very comfortable, with
clean linen, good cool drinks, and the tenderest hand.&nbsp; But he
was very sleepy, so sleepy that he hardly cared to hear of the
combat, only he roused himself for a moment to say, 'Brother, I
have seen Dolly.'</p>

<p>'Dolly!'</p>

<p>'Our sister Dolly.'</p>

<p>'Ah, Phil! many a strange visitor has come to me in the Walnut
Chamber at home.'</p>

<p>'I tell you I was in my perfect senses,' returned Philip; 'there
she was, just as when we left her.&nbsp; And, what was stranger
still, she talked French.'</p>

<p>'Sleep and see her again,' laughed Berenger.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLII.&nbsp; THE SILVER BULLET</h3>

<p>I am all wonder, O my son, my soul</p>

<p>Is stunned within me; powers to speak to him</p>

<p>Or to interrogate him have I none,</p>

<p>Or even to look on him.--Cowper's&nbsp; ODYSSEY</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his waking senses Philip adhered to his story that his little
sister Dolly had stood at the foot of his bed, called him <i>'le
pauvre'</i> and had afterwards disappeared, led away by the nursing
lady.&nbsp; It seemed to Berenger a mere delusion of feverish
weakness; for Philip had lost a great deal of blood, and the wound,
though not dangerous, permitted no attempt at moving, and gave much
pain.&nbsp; Of the perfections of the lady as nurse and surgeon
Philip could not say enough, and, pale and overwept as he allowed
her to be, he declared that he was sure that her beauty must equal
Mme. De Selinville's.&nbsp; Berenger laughed, and looking round
this strange hospital, now lighted by the full rays of the morning
sun, he was much struck by the scene.</p>

<p>It was the chancel of the old abbey church.&nbsp; The door by
which they had entered was very small, and perhaps had led merely
to the abbot's throne, as an irregularity for his own convenience,
and only made manifest by the rending away of the rich wooden stall
work, some fragments of which still clung to the walls.&nbsp; The
east end, like that of many French churches, formed a semicircle,
the high altar having been in the centre, and five tall deep bays
forming lesser chapels embracing it, their vaults all gathered up
into one lofty crown above, and a slender pillar separating between
each chapel, each of which further contained a tall narrow
window.&nbsp; Of course, all had been utterly desolated, and Philip
was actually lying in one of these chapels, where the sculptured
figure of St.&nbsp; John and his Eagle still remained on the wall;
and a sufficient remnant of his glowing sanguine robe of love was
still in the window to serve as a shield from the <i>
bise</i>.&nbsp; The high altar of rich marbles was a mere heap of
shattered rubbish; but what surprised Berenger more than all the
ruined architectural beauty which his <i>cinque-cento</i> trained
taste could not understand, was, that the tiles of the pavement
were perfectly clean, and diligently swept, the rubbish piled up in
corners; and here and there the relics of a cross or carved figure
lay together, as by a tender, reverential hand.&nbsp; Even the
morsels of painted glass had been placed side by side on the floor,
so as to form a mosaic of dark red, blue, and green; and a child's
toy lay beside this piece of patchwork.&nbsp; In the midst of his
observations, however, Captain Falconnet's servant came to summon
him to breakfast; and the old woman appearing at the same time, he
could not help asking whether the lady were coming.</p>

<p>'Oh yes, she will come to dress his wound in good time,'
answered the old woman.</p>

<p>'And when?&nbsp; I should like to hear what she thinks of it,'
said Berenger.</p>

<p>'How?' said the old woman with a certain satisfaction in his
disappointment; 'is our Lady of Hope to be coming down among you
gay gallants?'</p>

<p>'But who is this Lady of Hope?' demanded he.</p>

<p>'Who should she be but our good pastor's daughter?&nbsp; Ah! and
a brave, good daughter she was too, abiding the siege because his
breath was so bad that he could not be moved.'</p>

<p>'What was his name?' asked Berenger, attracted strangely by what
he heard.</p>

<p>'Ribault, Monsieur--Pasteur Ribault.&nbsp; Ah! a good man, and
sound preacher, when preach he could; but when he could not, his
very presence kept the monks' REVENANTS from vexing us--as a cat
keeps mice away; and, ah! The children have been changed creatures
since Madame dealt with them.&nbsp; What! Monsieur would know why
they call her our Lady of Hope?&nbsp; Esperance is her true name;
and, moreover, in the former days this abbey had an image that they
called Notre-Dame de l'Esperance, and the poor deceived folk
thought it did great miracles.&nbsp; And so, when she came hither,
and wrought such cures, and brought blessing wherever she went, it
became a saying among us that at length we had our true Lady of
Hope.</p>

<p>A more urgent summons here forced Berenger away, and his
repetition of the same question received much the same answer from
deaf old Captain Falconnet.&nbsp; He was obliged to repair to his
post with merely a piece of bread in his hand; abut, though
vigilance was needful, the day bade fair to be far less actively
occupied than its predecessor: the enemy were either disposed to
turn the siege into a blockade, or were awaiting reinforcements and
heavier artillery; and there were only a few desultory attacks in
the early part of the morning.&nbsp; About an hour before noon,
however, the besiegers seemed to be drawing out in arms, as if to
receive some person of rank, and at the same time sounds were heard
on the hills to the eastward, as if troops were on the march.&nbsp;
Berenger having just been told by the old sergeant that probably
all would be quiet for some time longer, and been almost laughed at
by the veteran for consulting him whether it would be permissible
for him to be absent a few minutes to visit his brother, was
setting out across the bridge for the purpose, his eyes in the
direction of the rampart, which followed the curve of the
river.&nbsp; The paths which--as has been said--the feet of the
washerwomen and drawers of water had worn away in quieter times,
had been smoothed and scarped away on the outer side, so as to come
to an abrupt termination some feet above the gay marigolds,
coltsfoot, and other spring flowers that smiled by the
water-side.&nbsp; Suddenly he beheld on the rampart a tiny gray and
white figure, fearlessly trotting, or rather dancing, along the
summit and the men around him exclaimed, 'The little moonbeam
child!'&nbsp; 'A fairy--a changeling!'--'They cannot shoot at such
a babe!'&nbsp; 'Nor could they harm her!'&nbsp; 'Hola! little
one!&nbsp; <i>Gare</i>! Go back to your mother!'&nbsp; 'Do not
disturb yourself, sir; she is safer than you,' were the
ejaculations almost at the same moment, while he sprang forward,
horrified at the peril of such an infant.&nbsp; He had reached the
angle between the bridge and rampart, when he perceived that
neither humanity nor superstition were protecting the poor child;
for, as she turned down the remnant of one of the treacherous
little paths, a man in bright steel and deep black had spurred his
horse to the river's brink, and was deliberately taking aim at
her.&nbsp; Furious at such brutality, Berenger fired the pistol he
held in his hand, and the wretch dropped from his horse; but at the
same moment his pistol exploded, and the child rolled down the
bank, whence a piteous wail came up, impelling Berenger to leap
down to her assistance, in the full face of the enemy.&nbsp;
Perhaps he was protected for the moment by the confusion ensuing on
the fall of the officer; and when he reached the bottom of the
bank, he saw the little creature on her feet, her round cap and
gray woollen dress stripped half off in the fall, and her flaxen
hair falling round her plump, white, exposed shoulder, but
evidently unhurt, and gathering yellow marigolds as composedly as
though she had been making May garlands.&nbsp; He snatched her up,
and she said, with the same infantine dignity, 'Yes, take me up;
the naughty people spoilt the path.&nbsp; But I must take my beads
first.'&nbsp; And she tried to struggle out of his arms, pointing
therewith to a broken string among the marshy herb-age on which
gleamed--the pearls of Ribaumont!</p>

<p>In the few seconds in which he grasped them, and then bore the
child up the embankment in desperate bounds, a hail of bullets
poured round him, ringing on his breastplate, shearing the plume
from his hat, but scarcely even heard; and in another moment he had
sprung down, on the inner side, grasping the child with all his
might, but not daring even to look at her, in the wondrous flash of
that first conviction.&nbsp; She spoke first.&nbsp; 'Put me down,
and let me have my beads,' she said in a grave, clear tone; and
then first he beheld a pair of dark blue eyes, a sweet wild-rose
face--Dolly's all over.&nbsp; He pressed her so fast and so close,
in so speechless and over powering an ecstasy, that again she
repeated, and in alarm, 'Put me down, I want my mother!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes! your mother! your mother! your mother!' he cried,
unable to let her out of his embrace; and then restraining himself
as he saw her frightened eyes, in absolute fear of her spurning
him, or struggling from him, 'My sweet! my child! Ah! do you not
know me?'&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, remembering how wild this was, he struggled to speak
calmly:</p>

<p>'What are you called, my treasure?'</p>

<p>'I am <i>la petite Rayonette</i>,' she said, with puzzled
dignity and gravity; 'and my mother says I have a beautiful long
name of my own besides.'</p>

<p>'Berangere--my Berangere---'</p>

<p>'That is what she says over me, as I go to sleep in her bosom at
night,' said the child, in a wondering voice, soon exchanged for
entreaty, 'Oh, hug me not so hard!&nbsp; Oh, let me go--let me go
to her!&nbsp; Mother! mother!'</p>

<p>'My child, mine own, I am take thee!--Oh, do not struggle with
me!' he cried, himself imploring now.&nbsp; 'Child, one kiss for
thy father;' and meantime, putting absolute force on his vehement
affection, he was hurrying to the chancel.</p>

<p>There Philip hailed them with a shout as of desperate anxiety
relieved; but before a word could be uttered, down the stairs flew
the Lady of Hope, crying wildly, 'Not there--she is not--' but
perceiving the little one in the stranger's arms, she held out her
own, crying, 'Ah! is she hurt, my angel?'</p>

<p>'Unhurt, Eustacie!&nbsp; Our child is unhurt!' Berenger said,
with an agonized endeavour to be calm; but for the moment her
instinct was so entirely absorbed in examining into the soundness
of her child's limbs, that she neither saw nor hear anything
else.</p>

<p>'Eustacie,' he said, laying his hand on her arm, she started
back, with bewildered eyes.&nbsp; 'Eustacie--wife? do you not know
me? &nbsp;Ah! I forgot that I am changed.'</p>

<p>'You--you--' she gasped, utterly confounded, and gazing as if
turned to stone, and though at that moment the vibration of a
mighty discharge of cannon rocked the walls, and strewed Philip's
bed with the crimson shivers of St. John's robe, yet neither of
them would have been sensible of it had not Humfrey rushed in at
the same moment, crying, 'They are coming on like friends,
sir!'</p>

<p>Berenger passed his hand over his face.&nbsp; 'You will know me
WHEN--IF I return, my dearest,' he said.&nbsp; 'If not, then still,
thank God!&nbsp; Philip, to you I trust them!'</p>

<p>And with one kiss on that still, cold, almost petrified brow, he
had dashed away.&nbsp; There was a space of absolutely motionless
silence, save that Eustacie let herself drop on the chancel step,
and the child, presently breaking the spell, pulled her to attract
her notice to the flowers.&nbsp; 'Mother, here are the <i>
soucis</i> for the poor gentleman's broth.&nbsp; See, the naughty
people had spoilt all the paths, and I rolled down and tore my
frock, and down fell the beads, but be not angry, mother dear, for
the good gentleman picked them up, and carried me up the bank.'</p>

<p>'The bank!' cried Eustacie, with a scream, as the sense of the
words reached her ears.&nbsp; 'Ah! no wonder! Well might thy danger
bring thy father's spirit;' and she grasped the little one
fervently in her arms, murmuring, 'Thank, thank God, indeed!&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; my precious one; and did He send that blessed spirit to
rescue thee?'</p>

<p>'And will you tie up my frock? and may I put the flowers into
the broth?' chattered Rayonette.&nbsp; 'And why did he kiss me and
hug me so tight? and how did he know what you say over me as we
fall asleep?'</p>

<p>Eustacie clasped her tighter, with a convulsive, shudder of
thankfulness; and Philip, but half hearing, and barely gathering
the meaning of her mood, ventured to speak, 'Madame---'</p>

<p>As if touched by an electric shock, Eustacie started up, as
recalled to instant needs, and coming towards him said, 'Do you
want anything, sir?&nbsp; Pardon one who has but newly seen a
spirit from the other world--brought by his child's danger.'&nbsp;
And the dazed, trance-like look was returning.</p>

<p>'Spirit!' cried Philip.&nbsp; 'Nay, Madame, it was
himself.&nbsp; Ah! and you are she whom we have sought so long; and
this dear child--no wonder she has Dolly's face.'</p>

<p>'Who--what?' said Eustacie, pressing her temples with her hands,
as if to retain her senses.&nbsp; 'Speak; was yonder a living or
dead man-- and who?'</p>

<p>'Living, thank God! and your own husband; that is, if you are
really Eustacie.&nbsp; Are you indeed?' he added, becoming
doubtful.</p>

<p>'Eustacie, that am I,' she murmured.&nbsp; 'But he is dead--they
killed him; I swathe blood where he had waited for me.&nbsp; His
child's danger brought him from the grave.'</p>

<p>'No, no.&nbsp; Look at me, sister Eustacie.&nbsp; Listen to
me.&nbsp; Osbert brought him home more dead than alive--but alive
still.'</p>

<p>'No!' she cried, half passionately.&nbsp; 'Never could he have
lived and left me to mourn him so bitterly.'</p>

<p>'If you knew--' cried Philip, growing indignant.&nbsp; 'for
weeks he lay in deadly lethargy, and when, with his left hand, he
wrote and sent Osbert to you, your kinsfolk threw the poor fellow
into a dungeon, and put us off with lies that you were married to
your cousin.&nbsp; All believed, only he--sick, helpless,
speechless, as he was--he trusted you still; and so soon as
Mericour came, though he could scarcely brook the saddle, nothing
would hold him from seeking you.&nbsp; We saw only ruin at La
Sablerie, and well-nigh ever since have we been clapped up in
prison by your uncle.&nbsp; We were on the way to Quinet to seek
you. &nbsp;He has kept his faith whole through wounds and pain and
prison and threats,--ay, and sore temptation,' cried Philip, waxing
eloquent; 'and, oh, it cannot be that you do not care for him!'</p>

<p>'Doubt not my faith, sir,' said Eustacie, proudly; 'I have been
as true to him as if I had known he lived.&nbsp; Nor do I know who
you are to question me.'</p>

<p>At this moment the child pressed forward, holding between her
tow careful plump hands a red earthenware bowl, with the tisane
steaming in it, and the yellow petals strewn over the
surface.&nbsp; She and Philip had taken a great fancy to each
other, and while her mother was busy with the other patients, she
had been left to her quiet play with her fragments of glass, which
she carried one by one to display, held up to the light, to her new
friends; who, in his weak state, and after his long captivity,
found her the more charming playmate because she so strangely
reminded him of his own little sisters.&nbsp; She thought herself
his little nurse, and missing from his broth the yellow petals that
she had been wont to think the charm of tisane, the housewifely
little being had trotted off, unseen and unmissed, across the
quadrangle, over the embankment, where she had often gathered them,
or attended on the <i>'lessive'</i> on the river's brink; and now
she broke forth exultingly, 'Here, here is the tisane, with all the
<i>soucis</i>. Let me feed you with them, sir.'</p>

<p>'Ah!&nbsp; thou sweet one,' gasped Philip, 'I could as soon eat
them as David could drink the water!&nbsp; For these--for
these---!' and the tears rushed into his eyes.&nbsp; 'Oh! let me
but kiss her, Madame; I loved her from the first moment.&nbsp; She
has the very face of my little sweeting, (what French word is good
enough for her?) didst run into peril for me, not knowing how near
I was to thee?&nbsp; What, must I eat it?&nbsp; Love me then.'</p>

<p>But the boarded door was thrown back, and 'Madame, more
wounded,' resounded.&nbsp; The thrill of terror, the elastic
reaction, at the ensuing words, 'from the north gate,' was what
made Eustacie in an instant know herself to be not widow but
wife.&nbsp; She turned round at once, holding out her hand, and
saying with a shaken, agitated voice, <i>'Mon frere</i>, pardon me,
I know not what I say; and, after all, he will find me <i>bien
mechante</i> still.'&nbsp; Then as Philip devoured her hand with
kisses, and held it fast, 'I must go; these poor men need me.&nbsp;
When I can, I will return.'</p>

<p>'Only let me have the little one,' entreated Philip; 'it is
almost home already to look at her.'</p>

<p>And when Eustacie next looked in on them, they were both fast
asleep.</p>

<p>She, poor thing, the only woman with brains among the many
scared females in the garrison, might not rest or look the wonder
in the face.&nbsp; Fresh sufferers needed her care, and related
gallant things of 'the Duke's Englishman,' things of desperate
daring and prowess that sent the blood throbbing to her heart with
exultation, but only to be followed by a pang of anguish at having
let him go back to peril--nay, perhaps, to death--without a word of
tenderness or even recognition. She imaged him as the sunny-faced
youth who had claimed her in the royal castle, and her longing to
be at his side and cling to him as his own became every moment more
fervent and irresistible, until she gladly recollected the
necessity of carrying food to the defenders; and snatching an
interval from her hospital cares, she sped to the old circular
kitchen of the monastery, where she found the lame baker vainly
trying to organize a party of frightened women to carry provisions
to the garrison of the bridge-tower.</p>

<p>'Give some to me,' she said.&nbsp; 'My husband is there!&nbsp; I
am come to fetch his dinner.'</p>

<p>The peasant women looked and whispered as if they thought that,
to add to their misfortunes, their Lady of Hope had become
distracted by grief; and one or two, who held the old faith, and
were like the crane among the sparrows, even observed that it was a
judgment for the profane name that had been given her, against
which she had herself uniformly protested.</p>

<p>'My husband is come,' said Eustacie, looking round with shining
eyes.&nbsp; 'Let us be brave wives, and not let our men
famish.'</p>

<p>She lifted a loaf and a pitcher of broth, and with the latter
poised on her erect and graceful head, and elastic though steady
step, she led the way; the others following her with a sort of awe,
as of one they fancied in a superhuman state.&nbsp; In fact, there
was no great danger in traversing the bridge with its lofty parapet
on either side; and her mind was too much exalted and moved to be
sensible of anything but a certain exulting awe of the battle
sounds.&nbsp; There was, however, a kind of lull in the assault
which had raged so fiercely ever since the fall of the officer, and
the arrival of the reinforcements.&nbsp; Either the enemy had
paused to take food, or were devising some fresh mode of attack;
and as the line of women advanced, there started forth from under
the arch a broad-shouldered, white-faced, golden-bearded personage,
who cried joyously, 'My dearest, my bravest! this for me!' and
lifted the pitcher from her head as he grasped her hand with a
flesh and blood clasp indeed, but the bright-cheeked, wavy-haired
lad of her dream withered away with a shock of disappointment, and
she only looked up with wistful puzzled earnestness instead of
uttering the dear name that she had so long been whispering to
herself.&nbsp; 'Dearest,' he said, 'this is precious indeed to me,
that you should let me feast my eyes once more on you.&nbsp; But
you may not tarry; the rogues may renew the attack at any
moment.'</p>

<p>She had thought of herself as insisting on standing beside him
and sharing his peril.&nbsp; Had he been himself she must have don
so, but this was a stranger, whose claiming her made her shrink
apart till she could feel the identity which, though she believed,
she could not realize.&nbsp; Her hand lay cold and tremulous within
his warm pressure, but he was too much wrought up and too full of
joy and haste to be sensible of anything but of the brave affection
that had dared all to come to him; and he was perfectly happy, even
as a trumpet-call among the foe warned him to press her fingers to
his lips and say, as his bright blue eye kindled, 'God grant that
we may meet and thank Him tonight!&nbsp; Farewell, my lost and
found!&nbsp; I fight as one who has something to fight for.'</p>

<p>He might not leave his post, but he watched her with eyes that
could not be satiated, as she recrossed the bridge; and, verily,
his superabundant ecstasy, and the energy that was born of it, were
all needed to sustain the spirits of his garrison through that
terrible afternoon.&nbsp; The enemy seemed to be determined to
carry the place before it could be relieved, and renewed the storm
again and again with increasing violence; while the defenders,
disheartened by their pertinacity, dismayed at the effects of the
heavy artillery, now brought to bear on the tower, and direfully
afraid of having the bridge destroyed, would have abandoned their
barbican and shut themselves up within the body of the place, had
not Berenger been here, there, and everywhere, directing,
commanding, exhorting, cheering, encouraging, exciting enthusiasm
by word and example, winning proud admiration by feats of valour
and dexterity sprung of the ecstatic inspiration of new-found
bliss, and watching, as the conscious defender of his own most
beloved, without a moment's respite, till twilight stillness sank
on the enemy, and old Falconnet came to relieve him, thanking him
for his gallant defence, and auguring that, by noonday tomorrow at
latest, M. le Duc would succour them, unless he were hampered by
any folly of this young Navarre.</p>

<p>Too blissful for the sense of fatigue, Berenger began to impart
to the Commandant his delight, but the only answer he got was
'Hope, yes, every hope;' and he again recognized what he had
already perceived, that the indistinctness of his utterance made
him entirely unintelligible to the deaf Commandant, and that
shouting did but proclaim to the whole garrison, perhaps even to
the enemy's camp, what was still too new a joy not to be a secret
treasure of delight.&nbsp; So he only wrung the old Captain's hand,
and strode away as soon as he was released.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark, in spite of a rising moon, but beneath the
cloister arch was torchlight, glancing on a steel head-piece, and
on a white cap, both bending down over a prostrate figure; and he
heard the voice he loved so well say, 'It is over!&nbsp; I can do
no more.&nbsp; It were best to dig his grave at once here in
silence--it will discourage the people less.&nbsp; Renaud and
Armand, here!'</p>

<p>He paused for a few minutes unseen in the shadow while she
closed the eyes and composed the limbs of the dead soldier; then,
kneeling, said the Lord's Prayer in French over him.&nbsp; Was this
the being he had left as the petted plaything of the palace?&nbsp;
When she rose, she came to the arch and gazed wistfully across the
moonlit quadrangle, beyond the dark shade cast by the buildings,
saying to the soldier, 'You are sure he was safe?'</p>

<p>'My Eustacie,' said Berenger, coming forward, 'we meet in grave
times!'</p>

<p>The relief of knowing him safe after the sickening yearnings and
suspense of the day, and moreover the old ring of tenderness in his
tone, made her spring to him with real warmth of gladness, and cry,
'It is you!&nbsp; All is well.'</p>

<p>'Blessedly well, <i>ma mie</i>, my sweetheart,' he said,
throwing his arm round her, and she rested against him murmuring,
'Now I feel it!&nbsp; Thou are thyself!'&nbsp; They were in the
dark cloister passage, and when he would have moved forward she
clung closer to him, and murmured, 'Oh, wait, wait, yet an
instant--thus I can feel that I have thee--the same--my own!'</p>

<p>'My poor darling,' said Berenger, after a second, 'you must
learn to bear with both my looks and speech, though I be but a
sorry shattered fellow for you.'</p>

<p>'No, no,' she cried, hanging on him with double fervour.&nbsp;
'No, I am loving you the more already,--doubly--trebly--a thousand
times.&nbsp; Only those moments were so precious, they made all
these long years as nothing.&nbsp; But come to the little one, and
to your brother.'</p>

<p>The little one had already heard them, and was starting forward
to meet them, though daunted for a moment by the sight of the
strange father: she stood on the pavement, in the full flood of the
moonlight from the east window, which whitened her fair face,
flaxen hair, and gray dress, so that she did truly look like some
spirit woven of the moonbeams.&nbsp; Eustacie gave a cry of
satisfaction:&nbsp; 'Ah! good, good; it was by moonlight that I saw
her first!'</p>

<p>Berenger took her in his arm, and held her to his breast with a
sense of insatiable love, while Philip exclaimed, 'Ay, well may you
make much of her, brother.&nbsp; Well might you seek them far and
wide.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such treasures are not to be found in the wide
world.'</p>

<p>Berenger without answering, carried the little one to the step
of the ruined high altar, and there knelt, holding Eustacie by the
hand, the child in one arm, and, with the moon glancing on his high
white brow and earnest face, he spoke a few words of solemn thanks
and prayer for a blessing on their reunion, and the babe so
wonderfully preserved to them.</p>

<p>Not till then did he carry her into the lamplight by Philip's
bed, and scan therein every feature, to satisfy his eyes with the
fulfilled hope that had borne him through those darkest days, when,
despairing of the mother, the thought of the child had still
sustained him to throw his will into the balance of the scale
between life and death.&nbsp; Little Berangere gazed up into his
face silently, with wondering, grave, and somewhat sleepy eyes, and
then he saw them fix themselves on his powder-grimed and
blood-stained hands.&nbsp; 'Ah! little heart,' he said, 'I am truly
in no state to handle so pure a piece of sugar as thou; I should
have rid myself of the battle-stains ere touching thee, but how
recollect anything at such a moment?'</p>

<p>Eustacie was glad he had broken the spell of silence; for having
recovered her husband, her first instinct was to wait upon
him.&nbsp; She took the child from him, explaining that she was
going to put her to bed in her own rooms up the stone stair, which
for the present were filled with fugitive women and children who
had come in from the country, so that the chancel must continue the
lodging of Berenger and his brother; and for the time of her
absence she brought him water to wash away the stains, and set
before him the soup she had kept warm over her little charcoal
brazier.&nbsp; It was only when thus left that he could own, in
answer to Philip's inquiries, that he could feel either hunger or
weariness; nay, he would only acknowledge enough of the latter to
give a perfect charm to rest under such auspices.&nbsp; Eustacie
had dispatched her motherly cares promptly enough to be with him
again just as in taking off his corselet he had found that it had
been pierced by a bullet, and pursuing the trace, through his
doublet, he found it lodged in that purse which he had so long worn
next his heart, where it had spent its force against the single
pearl of Ribaumont.&nbsp; And holding it up to the light, he saw
that it was of silver.&nbsp; Then there returned on him and Philip
the words they had heard two days before, of silver bullets forged
for the destruction of the white moonlight fairy, and he further
remembered the moment's shock and blow that in the midst of his
wild amaze on the river's bank had made him gather his breath and
strength to bound desperately upwards, lest the next moment he
should find himself wounded and powerless.</p>

<p>For the innocent, then, had the shot been intended; and she
running into danger out of her sweet, tender instincts of
helpfulness, had been barely saved at the extreme peril of her
unconscious father's life.&nbsp; Philip, whose vehement affection
for the little one had been growing all day, was in the act of
telling Berenger to string the bullet in the place of the injured
pearl, as the most precious heirloom of Ribaumont bravery, when
Eustacie returned, and learning all, grew pale and shuddered as
danger had never made her do before: but this strange day had
almost made a coward of her.</p>

<p>'And this is has spared,' said Berenger, taking out the string
of little yellow shells.&nbsp; 'Dost know them, sweet heart?&nbsp;
They have been my chaplet all this time.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' cried Eustacie, 'poor, good Mademoiselle Noemi! she
threaded them for my child, when she was very little.&nbsp; Ah!
could she have given them to you--could it then not have been
true--that horror?'</p>

<p>'Alas! it was too true.&nbsp; I found these shells in the empty
cradle, in the burnt house, and deemed them all I should ever have
of my babe.'</p>

<p>'Poor Noemi! poor Noemi!&nbsp; She always longed to be a martyr;
but we fled from her, and the fate we had brought on her.&nbsp;
That was the thought that preyed on my dear father.&nbsp; He
grieved so to have left his sheep--and it was only for my
sake.&nbsp; Ah! I have brought evil on all who have been good to
me, beginning with you.&nbsp; You had better cast me off, or I
shall bring yet worse!'</p>

<p>'Let it be so, if we are only together.'</p>

<p>He drew her to him and she laid her head on his shoulder,
murmuring, 'Ah! father, father, were you but here to see it. So
desolate yesterday, so ineffably blest today.&nbsp; Oh! I cannot
even grieve for him now, save that he could not just have seen us;
yet I think he knew it would be so.'</p>

<p>'Nay, it may be that he does see us,' said Berenger.&nbsp;
'Would that I had known who it was whom you were laying down "<i>en
paix et seurte bonne</i>!"&nbsp; As it was, the psalm brought
precious thoughts of Chateau Leurre, and the little wife who was
wont to sing it with me.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Eustacie, 'it was when he sang those words as he was
about to sleep in the ruin of the Temple that first I-- cowering
there in terror--knew him for no Templar's ghost, but for a
friend.&nbsp; That story ended my worst desolation.&nbsp; That
night he became my father; the next my child came to me!'</p>

<p>'My precious treasure!&nbsp; Ah! what you must have undergone,
and I all unknowing, capable of nothing wiser than going out of my
senses, and raging in a fever because I could convince no one that
those were all lies about your being aught but my true and loving
wife.&nbsp; But tell me, what brought thee hither to be the
tutelary patron, where, but for the siege, I had over-passed thee
on the way to Quinet?'</p>

<p>Then Eustacie told him how the Italian pedlar had stolen her
letters, and attempted to poison her child--the pedlar whom he soon
identified with that wizard who had talked to him of 'Esperance,'
until the cue had evidently been given by the Chevalier.&nbsp; Soon
after the Duke had dispatched a messenger to say that the Chevalier
de Ribaumont was on the way to demand his niece; and as it was a
period of peace, and the law was decidedly on his side, Madame de
Quinet would be unable to offer any resistance.&nbsp; She therefore
had resolved to send Eustacie away--not to any of the seaports
whither the uncle would be likely to trace her, but absolutely to a
place which he would have passed through on his journey into
Guyenne.&nbsp; The monastery of Notre-Dame de l'Esperance at Pont
de Dronne had been placed there, as well as a colony of
silk-spinners, attracted by the mulberry-trees of the old abbey
garden.&nbsp; These, however, having conceived some terror of the
ghosts of the murdered monks, had entreated for a pastor to protect
them; and Madame la Duchesse thought that in this capacity Isaac
Gardon, known by one of the many aliases to which the Calvinist
ministers constantly resorted, might avoid suspicion for the
present.&nbsp; She took the persecuted fugitives for some stages in
an opposite direction, in her own coach, then returned to face and
baffle the Chevalier, while her trusty steward, by a long <i>
detour</i>, conducted them to Pont de Dronne, which they reached
the very night after to Chevalier had returned through it to Nid de
Merle.</p>

<p>The pastor and his daughter were placed under the special
protection of Captain Falconnet, and the steward had taken care
that they should be well lodged in three rooms that had once been
the abbot's apartments.&nbsp; Their stay had been at first intended
to be short, but the long journey had been so full of suffering to
Isaac, and left such serious effects, that Eustacie could not bear
to undertake it again, and Madame de Quinet soon perceived that she
was safer there than at the chateau, since strangers were seldom
admitted to the fortress, and her presence there attracted no
attention.&nbsp; But for Isaac Gardon's declining health, Eustacie
would have been much happier here than at the chateau; the homely
housewifely life, where all depended on her, suited her; and, using
her lessons in domestic arts of nursing and medicine for the
benefit of her father's flock, she had found, to her dismay, that
the simple people, in their veneration, had made her into a sort of
successor to the patroness of the convent.&nbsp; Isaac had revived
enough for a time to be able to conduct the worship in the church,
and to instruct some his flock; but the teaching of the young had
been more and more transferred to her, and, as he ingenuously said,
had taught her more than she ever knew before.&nbsp; He gradually
became weaker through more suffering, and was absolutely incapable
of removal, when an attack by the Guisards was threatened.&nbsp;
Eustacie might have been sent back to Quinet; but she would not
hear of leaving him; and this first had been a mere slight attack,
as if a mere experiment on the strength of the place.&nbsp; She
had, however, then had to take the lead in controlling the women,
and teaching them to act as nurses, and to carry out provisions;
and she must then have been seen by some one, who reported her
presence there to Narcisse--perhaps by the Italian pedlar.&nbsp;
Indeed Humfrey, who came in for a moment to receive his master's
orders, report his watch, and greet his lady, narrated, on the
authority of the lately enlisted men-at-arms, that M. de Nid de
Merle had promised twenty crowns to any one who might shoot down
the heretics' little white <i>diablesse</i>.</p>

<p>About six weeks had elapsed since the first attack on Pont de
Dronne, and in that time Gardon had sunk rapidly.&nbsp; He died as
he lived, a gentle, patient man, not a characteristic Calvinist,
though his lot had been thrown with that party in his perplexed
life of truth-seeking and disappointment in the aspirations and
hopes of early youth.&nbsp; He had been, however, full of peace and
trust that he should open his eyes where the light was clear, and
no cloud on either side would mar his perception; and his
thankfulness had been great for the blessing that his almost
heaven-sent daughter had been to him in his loneliness,
bereavement, and decay.&nbsp; Much as he loved her, he did not show
himself grieved or distressed on her account; but, as he told her,
he took the summons to leave her as a sign that his task was done,
and the term of her trials ended.&nbsp; 'I trust as fully,' he
said, 'that thou wilt soon be in safe and loving hands, as though I
could commit thee to them.'</p>

<p>And so he died in her arms, leaving her a far fuller measure of
blessing and of love than ever she had derived from her own father;
and as the enemy's trumpets were already sounding on the hills, she
had feared insult to his remains, and had procured his almost
immediate burial in the cloister, bidding the assistants sing, as
his farewell, that evening psalm which had first brought soothing
to her hunted spirit.</p>

<p>There, while unable, after hours of weeping, to tear herself
from the grave of her father and protector, had she in her utter
desolation been startled by the summons, not only to attend to the
wounded stranger, but to lodge him in the chancel.&nbsp; 'Only this
was wanting,' was the first thought in her desolation, for this had
been her own most cherished resort.&nbsp; Either the <i>bise</i>,
or fear of a haunted spot, or both, had led to the nailing up of
boards over the dividing screen, so that the chancel was entirely
concealed from the church; and no one ever thought of setting foot
there till Eustacie, whose Catholic reverence was indestructible,
even when she was only half sure that it was not worse than a
foible, had stolen down thither, grieved at its utter desolation,
and with fond and careful hands had cleansed it, and amended the
ruin so far as she might.&nbsp; She had no other place where she
was sure of being uninterrupted; and here had been her oratory,
where she daily prayed, and often came to hide her tears and rally
her spirits through that long attendance on her fatherly
friend.&nbsp; It had been a stolen pleasure.&nbsp; Her reverent
work there, if once observed, would have been treated as rank
idolatry; and it was with consternation as well as grief that she
found, by the Captain's command, that this her sanctuary and refuge
was to be invaded by strange soldiers!&nbsp; Little did she
think---!</p>

<p>And thus they sat, telling each other all, on the step of the
ruined chancel, among the lights and shadows of the apse.&nbsp; How
unlike to stately Louvre's halls of statuary and cabinets of
porcelain, or the Arcadian groves of Montpipeau! And yet how little
they recked that they were in a beleaguered fortress, in the midst
of ruins, wounded sufferers all around, themselves in hourly
jeopardy.&nbsp; It was enough that they had one another.&nbsp; They
were so supremely happy that their minds unconsciously gathered up
those pale lights and dark fantastic shades as adjuncts of their
bliss.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIII<i>.&nbsp; LE BAISER D'EUSTACIE</i></h3>

<p>No pitying voice, no eye, affords</p>

<p>One tear to grace his obsequies.--GRAY</p>

<p>Golden sunshine made rubies and sapphires of the fragments of
glass in the windows of Notre-Dame de l'Esperance, and lighted up
the brown face and earnest eyes of the little dark figure, who,
with hands clasped round her knees, sat gazing as if she could
never gaze her fill, upon the sleeping warrior beside whom she sat,
his clear straight profile like a cameo, both in chiselling and in
colour, as it lay on the brown cloak where he slept the profound
sleep of content and of fatigue.</p>

<p>Neither she nor Philip would have spoken or stirred to break
that well-earned rest; but sounds from without were not long in
opening his eyes, and as they met her intent gaze, he smiled and
said, 'Good morrow, sweet heart!&nbsp; What, learning how ugly a
fellow is come back to thee?'</p>

<p>'No, indeed!&nbsp; I was trying to trace thine old likeness, and
then wondering how I ever liked thy boyish face better than the
noble look thou bearest now!'</p>

<p>'Ah! when I set out to come to thee, I was a walking rainbow;
yet I was coxcomb enough to think thou wouldst overlook it.'</p>

<p>'Show me those cruel strokes,' she said; 'I see one'--and her
finger traced the seam as poor King Charles had done--'but where is
the one my wicked cousin called by that frightful name?'</p>

<p>'Nay, verily, that sweet name spared my life!&nbsp; A little
less spite at my peach cheek, and I had been sped, and had not
lisped and stammered all my days in honour of <i>le baiser
d'Eustacie</i>!' and as he pushed aside his long golden silk
moustache to show the ineffaceable red and purple scar, he added,
smiling, 'It has waited long for its right remedy.'</p>

<p>At that moment the door in the rood-screen opened.&nbsp; Captain
Falconnet's one eye stared in amazement, and from beneath his gray
moustache thundered forth the word '<i>Comment</i>!' in accents fit
to wake the dead.</p>

<p>Was this Esperance, the most irreproachable of pastor's
daughters and widows?&nbsp; 'What, Madame, so soon as your good
father is under ground?&nbsp; At least I thought ONE woman could be
trusted; but it seems we must see to the wounded ourselves.'</p>

<p>She blushed, but stood her ground; and Berenger shouted, 'She is
my wife, sir!--my wife whom I have sought so long!'</p>

<p>'That must be as Madame la Duchesse chooses,' said the
Captain.&nbsp; 'She is under her charge, and must be sent to her as
soon as this <i>canaille</i> is cleared off.&nbsp; To your rooms,
Madame!'</p>

<p>'I am her husband!' again cried Berenger.&nbsp; 'We have been
married sixteen years.'</p>

<p>'You need not talk to me of dowry; Madame la Duchesse will
settle that, if you are fool enough to mean anything by it.&nbsp;
No, no, Mademoiselle, I've no time for folly.&nbsp; Come with me,
sir, and see if that be true which they say of the rogues
outside.'</p>

<p>And putting his arm into Berenger's, he fairly carried him off,
discoursing by the way on <i>feu</i> M. l'Amiral's saying that
'over-strictness in camp was perilous, since a young saint, an old
devil,' but warning him that this was prohibited gear, as he was
responsible for the young woman to Madame la Duchesse.&nbsp;
Berenger, who had never made the Captain hear anything that he did
not know before, looked about for some interpreter whose voice
might be more effectual, but found himself being conducted to the
spiral stair of the church steeple; and suddenly gathering that
some new feature in the case had arisen, followed the old man
eagerly up the winding steps to the little square of leaden roof
where the Quinet banner was planted.&nbsp; It commanded a wide and
splendid view, to the Bay of Biscay on the one hand, and the inland
mountains on the other; but the warder who already stood there
pointed silently to the north, where, on the road by which Berenger
had come, was to be seen a cloud of dust, gilded by the rays of the
rising sun.</p>

<p>Who raised it was a matter of no doubt; and Berenger's morning
orisons were paid with folded hands, in silent thanks-giving, as he
watched the sparkling of pikes and gleaming of helmets--and the
white flag of Bourbon at length became visible.</p>

<p>Already the enemy below were sending out scouts--they rode to
the top of the hill--then a messenger swan his horse across the
river.&nbsp; In the camp before the bridge-tower men buzzed out of
their tents, like ants whose hill is disturbed; horses were
fastened to the cannon, tents were struck, and it was plain that
the siege was to be raised.</p>

<p>Captain Falconnet did his ally the honour to consult him on the
expedience of molesting the Guisards by a sally, and trying to take
some of their guns; but Berenger merely bowed to whatever he said,
while he debated aloud the PROS and CONS, and at last decided that
the garrison had been too much reduced for this, and that M. le Duc
would prefer finding them drawn up in good order to receive him, to
their going chasing and plundering disreputable among the enemy--
the Duke being here evidently a much greater personage than the
King of Navarre, hereditary Governor of Guyenne though he
were.&nbsp; Indeed, nothing was wanting to the confusion of
Berenger's late assailants.&nbsp; In the camp on the north side of
the river, things were done with some order; but that on the other
side was absolutely abandoned, and crowds were making in disorder
for the ford, leaving everything behind them, that they might not
have their retreat cut off.&nbsp; Would there be a battle?
Falconnet, taking in with his eye the numbers of the succouring
party, thought the Duke would allow the besiegers to depart
unmolested, but remembered with a sigh that young king had come to
meddle in their affair!</p>

<p>However, it was needful to go down and marshal the men for the
reception of the new-comers, or to join in the fight, as the case
might be.</p>

<p>And it was a peaceful entrance that took place some hours later,
and was watched from the windows of the prior's rooms by Eustacie,
her child, and Philip, whom she had been able to install in her own
apartments, which had been vacated by the refugee women in haste to
return home, and where he now sat in Maitre Gardon's great straw
chair, wrapped in his loose gown, and looking out at the northern
gates, thrown open to receive the King and Duke, old Falconnet
presenting the keys to the Duke, the Duke bowing low as he offered
them to the King, and the King waving them back to the Duke and the
Captain.&nbsp; Then they saw Falconnet presenting the tall
auxiliary who had been so valuable to him, his gesture as he
pointed up to the window, and the King's upward look, as he doffed
his hat and bowed low, while Eustacie responded with the most
graceful of reverences, such as reminded Philip that his little
sister-in-law and tender nurse was in truth a great court lady.</p>

<p>Presently Berenger came up-stairs, bringing with him his
faithful foster-brother Osbert, who, though looking gaunt and lean,
had nearly recovered his strength, and had accompanied the army in
hopes of finding his master.&nbsp; The good fellow was full of
delight at the welcome of his lady, and at once bestirred himself
in assisting her in rectifying the confusion in which her guests
had left her apartment.</p>

<p>Matters had not long been set straight when steps were heard on
the stone stair, and, the door opening wide, Captain Falconnet's
gruff voice was heard, 'This way, Monseigneur; this way, Sire.'</p>

<p>This was Madame la Baronne de Ribaumont's first reception.&nbsp;
She was standing at the dark walnut table, fresh starching and
crimping Berenger's solitary ruff, while under her merry
superintendence those constant playfellows, Philip and Rayonette,
were washing, or pretending to wash, radishes in a large wooden
bowl, and Berenger was endeavouring to write his letter of good
tidings, to be sent by special messenger to his grand-father.&nbsp;
Philip was in something very like a Geneva gown; Eustacie wore her
prim white cap and frill, and coarse black serge kirtle; and there
was but one chair besides that one which Philip was desired to
retain, only two three-legged stools and a bench.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Madame de Ribaumont was equal to the occasion;
nothing could have been more courtly, graceful, or unembarrassed
than her manner of receiving of King's gallant compliments, and of
performing all the courtesies suited to the hostess and queen of
the place: it was the air that would have befitted the stateliest
castle hall, yet that in its simplicity and brightness still more
embellished the old ruinous convent-cell.&nbsp; The King was
delighted, he sat down upon one of the three-legged stools, took
Rayonette upon his knee, undertook to finish washing the radishes,
but ate nearly all he washed, declaring that they put him in mind
of his old hardy days on the mountains of Bearn.&nbsp; He insisted
on hearing all Rayonette's adventure in detail; and on seeing the
pearls and the silver bullet, 'You could scarcely have needed the
token, sir,' said he with a smile to Berenger; 'Mademoiselle had
already shown herself of the true blood of the bravest of
knights.'</p>

<p>The tidings of the attack on Pont de Dronne had caused the Duke
to make a forced march to its relief, in which the King had
insisted on joining him; and they now intended to wait at Pont de
Dronne till the rest of the troops came up, and to continue their
march through Guyenne to Nerac, the capital of Henry's county of
Foix.&nbsp; The Duke suggested that if Philip were well enough to
move when the army proceeded, the family might then take him to
Quinet, where the Duchess would be very desirous to see Madame; and
therewith they took leave with some good-humoured mirth as to
whether M. le Ribaumont would join them at supper, or remain in the
bosom of his family, and whether he were to be regarded as a gay
bridegroom or a husband of sixteen year's standing.</p>

<p>'Nay,' said the King, 'did his good Orpheus know how nearly his
Eurydice had slipped through his fingers again? how M. de Quinet
had caught the respectable Pluto yonder in the gray moustache
actually arranging an escort to send the lady safe back to Quinet
<i>bon gre malgre</i>--and truly a deaf Pluto was worse than even
Orpheus had encountered!'</p>

<p>So laughing, he bowed again his compliments; but Eustacie
demanded, so soon as he was gone, what he meant by calling her by
such names.&nbsp; If he thought it was her Christian name, it was
over-familiar--if not, she liked it less.</p>

<p>'It is only that he last saw you in the Infernal Region, <i>ma
mie</i>,' said Berenger; 'and I have sought you ever since, as
Orpheus sought Eurydice.'</p>

<p>But her learning did not extend so far; and when the explanation
was made, she pouted, and owned that she could not bear to be
reminded of the most foolish and uncomfortable scene in her life--
the cause of all her troubles; and as Berenger was telling her of
Diane's confession that her being involved in the pageant was part
of the plot for their detention at Paris, Osbert knocked at the
door, and entered with a bundle in his arms, and the air of having
done the right thing.</p>

<p>'There, sir,' he said with proud satisfaction, 'I have been to
the camp across the river.&nbsp; I heard there were good stuffs to
be had there for nothing, and thought I would see if I could find a
coat for Monsieur Philippe, for his own is a mere ruin.'</p>

<p>This was true, for Eustacie had been deciding that between blood
and rents it had become a hopeless case for renovation; and Osbert
joyfully displayed a beautifully-embroidered coat of soft leather,
which he had purchased for a very small sum of a plunderer who had
been there before him.&nbsp; The camp had been so hastily abandoned
that all the luggage had been left, and, like a true valet, Osbert
had not neglected the opportunity of replenishing his master's
wardrobe.&nbsp; 'And,' said he, 'I saw there on whom M. le Baron
knows, --M. de Nid de Merle.'</p>

<p>'Here!' cried Eustacie, startled for a moment, but her eyes
resting reassured on her husband.</p>

<p>'Madame need not be alarmed,' said Osbert; 'M. le Baron has well
repaid him.&nbsp; Ah! ah! there he lies, a spectacle for all good
Christians to delight in.'</p>

<p>'It was then he, <i>le scelerat</i>?' exclaimed Berenger; 'I
have already thought it possible.'</p>

<p>'And he fell by your hands!' cried Eustacie.&nbsp; 'That is as
it should be.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Madame,' said Osbert; 'it did my very heart good to see
him writhing there like a crushed viper.&nbsp; M. le Baron's bullet
was mortal, and his own people thought him not worth the moving, so
there he lies on the ground howling and cursing.&nbsp; I would have
given him the <i>coup de grace</i> myself, but that I thought M. le
Baron might have some family matters to settle with him; so I only
asked what he thought now of clapping guiltless folk into dungeons,
and shooting innocent children like sparrows; but he grinned and
cursed like a demon, and I left him.'</p>

<p>'In any one's charge?' asked Berenger.</p>

<p>'In the field's, who is coming for him,' said the descendant of
the Norseman.&nbsp; 'I only told Humfrey that if he saw any one
likely to meddle he should tell them he was reserved for you.&nbsp;
Eh! M. le Baron is not going now.&nbsp; Supper is about to be
served, and if M. le Baron would let me array him with this ruff of
Spanish point, and wax the ends of his belle moustache---'</p>

<p>'It is late,' added Eustacie, laying her hand on his arm; 'there
may be wild men about--he may be desperate!&nbsp; Oh, take
care!'</p>

<p><i>'Ma mie</i>, do you not think me capable of guarding myself
from a wild cat leap of a dying man?&nbsp; He must not be left
thus.&nbsp; Remember he is a Ribaumont.'</p>

<p>Vindictiveness and revenge had their part in the fire of
Eustacie's nature. Many a time had she longed to strangle Narcisse;
and she was on the point of saying, 'Think of his attempts on that
little one's life--think of your wounds and captivity;' but she had
not spent three years with Isaac Gardon without learning that there
was sin in giving way to her keen hatred; and she forced herself to
silence, while Berenger said, reading her face, 'Keep it back,
sweet heart!&nbsp; Make it not harder for me.&nbsp; I would as soon
go near a dying serpent, but it were barbarity to leave him as
Osbert describes.'</p>

<p>Berenger was too supremely and triumphantly happy not to be full
of mercy; and as Osbert guided him to the hut where the miserable
man lay, he felt little but compassion.&nbsp; The scene was worse
than he had expected; for not only had the attendants fled, but
plunderers had come in their room, rent away the coverings from the
bed, and torn the dying man from it.&nbsp; Livid, nearly naked,
covered with blood, his fingers hacked, and ears torn for the sake
of the jewels on them, lay the dainty and effeminate tiger-fop of
former days, moaning and scarcely sensible.&nbsp; But when the
mattress had been replaced, and Berenger had lifted him back to it,
laid a cloak over him, and moistened his lips, he opened his eyes,
but only to exclaim, 'You there! As if I had not enough to mock
me!&nbsp; Away!' and closed them sullenly.</p>

<p>'I would try to relieve you, cousin,' said Berenger.</p>

<p>The answer was a savage malediction on hypocrisy, and the words,
'And my sister?'</p>

<p>'Your sister is in all honour and purity at the nunnery of
Lucon.'</p>

<p>He laughed a horrible, incredulous laugh.&nbsp; 'Safely disposed
of ere you cajoled <i>la petite</i> with the fable of your
faithfulness!&nbsp; Nothing like a Huguenot for lying to both
sides;' and then ensued another burst of imprecations on the delay
that had prevented him from seizing the fugitives--till be--till be
felt as if the breath of hell were upon him, and could not help
vindicating himself, vain though he knew it to be: 'Narcisse de
Ribaumont,' he said gravely, 'my word has never been broken, and
you know the keeping of it has not been without cost.&nbsp; On that
word believe that Madame de Selinville is as spotless a matron as
when she periled herself to save my life.&nbsp; I never even knew
her sex till I had drawn her half drowned from the sea, and after
that I only saw her in the presence of Dom Colombeau of Nissard, in
whose care I left her.'</p>

<p>Narcisse's features contorted themselves into a frightful sneer
as he muttered, 'The intolerable fool; and that he should have got
the better of me, that is if it be true--and I believe not a word
of it.'</p>

<p>'At least,' said Berenger, 'waste not these last hours on hating
and reviling me, but let this fellow of mine, who is a very fair
surgeon, bind your wound again.'</p>

<p>'Eh!' said Narcisse, spitefully, turning his head, 'your own
rogue?&nbsp; Let me see what work he made of <i>le baiser
d'Eustacie</i>.&nbsp; Pray, how does it please her?'</p>

<p>'She thanks Heaven that your chief care was to spoil my
face.'</p>

<p>'I hear she is a prime doctress; but of course you brought her
not hither lest she should hear HOW you got out of our
keeping.'&nbsp;</p>

<p>'She knows it.'</p>

<p>'Ah! she has been long enough at court to know one must
overlook, that one's own little matters may be overlooked.'</p>

<p>Berenger burst out at last, 'Her I will not hear blasphemed: the
next word against her I leave you to yourself.'</p>

<p>'That is all I want,' said Narcisse.&nbsp; 'These cares of yours
are only <i>douceurs</i> to your conceited heretical conscience,
and a lengthening out of this miserable affair.&nbsp; You would
scoff at the only real service you could render me.'</p>

<p>'And that is---'</p>

<p>'To fetch a priest.&nbsp; Ha! ha! one of your sort would sooner
hang me.&nbsp; You had rather see me perish body and soul in this
Huguenot dog-hole!&nbsp; What! do you stammer?&nbsp; Bring a
psalm-singing heretic here, and I'll teach him and you what you MAY
call blasphemy.'</p>

<p>'A priest you shall have, cousin,' said Berenger, gravely; 'I
will do my utmost to bring you one.&nbsp; Meanwhile, strive to
bring yourself into a state in which he may benefit you.'</p>

<p>Berenger was resolved that the promise should be kept.&nbsp; He
saw that despair was hardening the wretched man's heart, and that
the possibility of fulfilling his Church's rites might lead him to
address himself to repentance; but the difficulties were
great.&nbsp; Osbert, the only Catholic at hand, was disposed to
continue his vengeance beyond the grave, and only at his master's
express command would even exercise his skill to endeavour to
preserve life till the confessor could be brought.&nbsp; Ordinary
Huguenots would regard the desire of Narcisse as a wicked
superstition, and Berenger could only hurry back to consult some of
the gentlemen who might be supposed more unprejudiced.</p>

<p>As he was crossing the quadrangle at full speed, he almost ran
against the King of Navarre, who was pacing up and down reading
letters, and who replied to his hasty apologies by saying he looked
as if the fair Eurydice had slipped through his hands again into
the Inferno.</p>

<p>'Not so, Sire, but there is one too near those gates.&nbsp; Nid
de Merle is lying at the point of death, calling for a priest.'</p>

<p><i>'Ventre Saint-Gris</i>!' exclaimed the King, 'he is the very
demon of the piece, who carved your face, stole your wife, and had
nearly shot your daughter.'</p>

<p>'The more need of his repentance, Sire, and without a priest he
will not try to repent.&nbsp; I have promised him one.'</p>

<p>'A bold promise!' said Henry.&nbsp; 'Have you thought how our
good friends here are likely to receive a priest of Baal into the
camp?'</p>

<p>'No, Sire, but my best must be done.&nbsp; I pray you counsel
me.'</p>

<p>Henry laughed at the simple confidence of the request, but
replied, 'The readiest way to obtain a priest will be to ride with
a flag of truce to the enemy's camp--they are at St. Esme--and say
that M. de Nid de Merle is a prisoner and dying, and that I offer
safe-conduct to any priest that will come to him--though whether a
red-hot Calvinist will respect my safe-conduct or your escort is
another matter.'</p>

<p>'At least, Sire, you sanction my making this request?'</p>

<p>'Have you men enough to take with you to guard you from
marauders?'</p>

<p>'I have but two servants, Sire, and I have left them with the
wounded man.'</p>

<p>'Then I will send with you half a dozen Gascons, who have been
long enough at Paris with me to have no scruples.'</p>

<p>By the time Berenger had explained matters to his wife and
brother, and snatched a hasty meal, a party of gay,
soldierly-looking fellows were in the saddle, commanded by a
bronzed sergeant who was perfectly at home in conducting messages
between contending parties.&nbsp; After a dark ride of about five
miles, the camp at the village of St. Esme was reached, and this
person recommended that he himself should go forward with a
trumpet, since M. de Ribaumont was liable to be claimed as an
escaped prisoner.&nbsp; There was then a tedious delay, but at
length the soldier returned, and another horseman with him.&nbsp; A
priest who had come to the camp in search of M. de Nid de Merle was
willing to trust himself to the King of Navarre's safe-conduct.</p>

<p>'Thanks, sir,' cried Berenger; 'this is a work of true
charity.'</p>

<p>'I think I know that voice,' said the priest.</p>

<p>'The priest of Nissard!'</p>

<p>'Even so, sir. I was seeking M. de Nid de Merle, and had but
just learnt that he had been left behind wounded.'</p>

<p>'You came to tell him of his sister?'</p>

<p>And as they rode together the priest related to Berenger that M.
de Solivet had remained in the same crushed, humiliated mood, not
exactly penitent, but too much disappointed and overpowered with
shame to heed what became of her provided she were not taken back
to her brother or her aunt.&nbsp; She knew that repentance alone
was left for her, and permitted herself to be taken to Lucon, where
Mere Monique was the only person whom she had ever respected.&nbsp;
There had no doubt been germs of good within her, but the crime and
intrigue of the siren court of Catherine de Medicis had choked
them; and the first sense of better things had been awakened by the
frank simplicity of the young cousin, while, nevertheless, jealousy
and family tactics had led her to aid in his destruction, only to
learn through her remorse how much she loved him.&nbsp; And when in
his captivity she thought him in her power, but found him beyond
her reach, unhallowed as was her passion, yet still the
contemplation of the virtues of one beloved could not fail to raise
her standard.&nbsp; It was for his truth and purity that she had
loved him, even while striving to degrade these quantities; and
when he came forth from her ordeal unscathed, her worship of him
might for a time be more intense, but when the idol was removed,
the excellence she had first learnt to adore in him might yet lead
that adoration up to the source of all excellence.&nbsp; All she
sought NOW was shelter wherein to weep and cower unseen; but the
priest believed that her tears would soon spring from profound
depths of penitence such as often concluded the lives of the gay
ladies of France.&nbsp; Mere Monique had received her tenderly, and
the good priest had gone from Lucon to announce her fate to her
aunt and brother.</p>

<p>At Bellaise he had found the Abbess much scandalized.&nbsp; She
had connived at her niece's releasing the prisoner, for she had
acquired too much regard for him to let him perish under Narcisse's
hands, and she had allowed Veronique to personate Diane at the
funeral mass, and also purposely detained Narcisse to prevent the
detection of the escape; but the discovery that her niece had
accompanied his flight had filled her with shame and furry.</p>

<p>Pursuit had been made towards La Rochelle, but when the
neighbourhood of the King of Navarre became known, no doubt was
entertained that the fugitives had joined him, and Narcisse,
reserving his vengeance for the family honour till he should
encounter Berenger, had hotly resumed the intention of pouncing on
Eustacie at Pont de Dronne, which had been decided on upon the
report of the Italian spy, and only deferred by his father's
death.&nbsp; This once done, Berenger's own supposed infidelity
would have forced him to acquiesce in the annulment of the original
marriage.</p>

<p>It had been a horrible gulf, and Berenger shuddered as one who
had barely struggled to the shore, and found his dear ones safe,
and his enemies shattered and helpless on the strand.&nbsp; They
hurried on so as to be in time.&nbsp; The priest, a brave and
cautious man, who had often before carried the rites of the Church
to dying men in the midst of the enemy, was in a secular dress, and
when Berenger had given the password, and obtained admittance they
separated, and only met again to cross the bridge.&nbsp; They found
Osbert and Humfrey on guard, saying that the sufferer still
lingered, occasionally in a terrible paroxysm of bodily anguish,
but usually silent, except when he upbraided Osbert with his
master's breach of promise or incapacity to bring a priest through
his Huguenot friends.</p>

<p>Such a taunt was on his tongue when Pere Colombeau entered, and
checked the scoff by saying, 'See, my son, you have met with more
pardon and mercy even on earth than you had imagined possible.'</p>

<p>There was a strange spasm on Narcisse's ghastly face, as though
he almost regretted the obligation forced on him, but Berenger
scarcely saw him again.&nbsp; It was needful for the security of
the priest and the tranquillity of the religious rites that he
should keep watch outside, lest any of the more fanatical of the
Huguenots should deem it their duty to break in on what they had
worked themselves into believing offensive idolatry.</p>

<p>His watch did not prove uncalled for.&nbsp; At different times
he had to plead the King's safe-conduct, and his own honour, and
even to defend his own Protestantism by appealing to his wounds and
services.&nbsp; Hearts were not soft enough then for the cruelty of
disturbing a dying man to be any argument at all in that fierce
camp; but even there the name of Pere Colombeau met with
respect.&nbsp; The saintly priest had protected too many enemies
for any one who had heard of him to wish him ill.</p>

<p>Nearly all night was Berenger thus forced to remain on guard,
that the sole hope of Narcisse's repentance and salvation might not
be swept away by violence from without, renewing bitterness
within.&nbsp; Not till towards morning was he called back.&nbsp;
The hard, lingering death struggle had spent itself, and slow
convulsive gasps showed that life was nearly gone; but the satanic
sneer had passed away, and a hand held out, a breathing like the
word 'pardon' seemed to be half uttered, and was answered from the
bottom of Berenger's kind and pitying heart.&nbsp; Another quarter
of an hour, and Narcisse de Ribaumont Nid de Merle was dead.&nbsp;
The priest looked pale, exhausted, shocked, but would reveal
nothing of the frame of mind he had shown, only that if he had been
touched by any saving penitence, it was owing to his kinsman.</p>

<p>Berenger wished to send the corpse to rest in the family vault
at Bellaise, where the Chevalier had so lately been laid; and the
priest undertook to send persons with a flag of truce to provide
for the transport, as well as to announce the death to the sister
and the aunt.&nbsp; Wearied as he was, he would not accept
Berenger's earnest invitation to come and take rest and refreshment
in the prior's rooms, but took leave of him at the further side of
the fortress, with almost reverent blessings, as to one not far
from the kingdom of heaven; and Berenger, with infinite
peacefulness in his heart, went home in the silence of the Sunday
morning, and lay sleeping away his long fatigue through the chief
part of the day, while Pastor Merlin was preaching and eloquent
sermon upon his good brother Isaac Gardon, and Eustacie shed filial
tears, more of tenderness than sorrow.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV.&nbsp; THE GALIMAFRE</h3>

<p>Speats and raxes, speats and raxes, speat and raxes</p>

<p>Lord Somerville's billet</p>

<p>Never wont to let the grass grow under his feet, Henry of
Navarre was impatient of awaiting his troops at Pont de Dronne, and
proposed to hasten on to Quinet, as a convenient centre for
collecting the neighbouring gentry for conference.&nbsp; Thus,
early on Monday, a party of about thirty set forth on horseback,
including the Ribaumonts, Rayonette being perched by turns in front
of her father or mother, and the Duke de Quinet declaring that he
should do his best to divide the journey into stages not too long
for Philip, since he was anxious to give his mother plenty of time
to make preparations for her royal guest.</p>

<p>He had, however, little reckoned on the young King's
promptitude.&nbsp; The first courier he had dispatched was
overtaken at a <i>cabaret</i> only five leagues from Pont de
Dronne, baiting his horse, as he said; the second was found on the
road with a lame horse; and the halt a day's journey remained
beyond it.&nbsp; The last stage had been ridden, much to the Duke's
discontent, for it brought them to a mere village inn, with
scarcely any accommodation.&nbsp; The only tolerable bed was
resigned by the King to the use of Philip, whose looks spoke the
exhaustion of which his tongue scorned to complain.&nbsp; So
painful and feverish a night ensued that Eustacie was anxious that
he should not move until the Duke should, as he promised, send a
mule litter back for him; but this proposal he resented; and in the
height of his constitutional obstinacy, appeared booted and spurred
at the first signal to mount.</p>

<p>Nor could Eustacie, as she soon perceived, annoy him more than
by showing her solicitude for him, or attracting to him the notice
of the other cavaliers.&nbsp; As the only lady of the party, she
received a great deal of attention, with some of which she would
gladly have dispensed.&nbsp; Whether it were the King's habit of
calling her <i>'la Belle Eurydice</i>,' or because, as she said, he
was <i>'si laid</i>' and reminded her of old unhappy days of
constraint, she did not like him, and had almost displeased her
husband and his brother by saying so.&nbsp; She would gladly have
avoided the gallantries of this day's ride by remaining with Philip
at the inn; but not only was this impossible, but the peculiar
ill-temper of concealed suffering made Philip drive her off
whenever she approached him with inquiries; so that she was forced
to leave him to his brother and Osbert, and ride forward between
the King and the Duke, the last of whom she really liked.</p>

<p>Welcome was the sight of the grand old chateau, its mighty wings
of chestnut forest stretching up the hills on either side, and the
stately avenue extending before it; but just then the last courier
was discovered, reeling in his saddle under the effects of repeated
toasts in honour of Navarre and Quinet.</p>

<p>'We are fairly sped,' said the Duke to Eustacie, shrugging his
shoulders between amusement and dismay.</p>

<p>'Madame la Duchesse is equal to any <i>galimafre</i>,' said
Eustacie, demurely; at which the Duke laughed heartily, saying, 'It
is not for the family credit I fear, but for my own!'</p>

<p>'Nay, triumph makes everything be forgiven.'</p>

<p>'But not forgotten,' laughed the Duke.&nbsp; 'But, <i>
allons</i>.&nbsp; Now for the onset.&nbsp; We are already
seen.&nbsp; The forces muster at the gateway.'</p>

<p>By the time the cavalcade were at the great paved archway into
the court, the Duchess stood at the great door, a grandson on
either side, and a great burly fresh-coloured gentleman behind
her.</p>

<p>M. de Quinet was off his horse in a second, his head bare, his
hand on the royal rein, and signing to his eldest son to hold the
stirrup; but, before the boy had comprehended, Henry had sprung
down, and was kissing the old lady's hand, saying, 'Pardon,
Madame!&nbsp; I trust to your goodness for excusing this surprise
from an old friend's son.'</p>

<p>Neither seeing nor caring for king or prince, the stranger
gentleman at the same moment pounced upon Eustacie and her little
girl, crying aloud in English, 'Here she is!&nbsp; My dear, I am
glad to see you.&nbsp; Give her to me, poor Berenger's little
darling.&nbsp; Ah! she does not understand.&nbsp; Where's
Merrycourt?'</p>

<p>Just then there was another English exclamation, 'My
father!&nbsp; Father! dear father!' and Philip, flinging himself
from the saddle, fell almost prone on that broad breast, sobbing
convulsively, while the eyes that, as he truly boasted, had never
wasted a tear on his enemies, were streaming so fast that his
father's welcome savoured of reproof: 'What's all this?&nbsp;
Before these French too.'</p>

<p>'Take care, father,' cried Berenger, leaping from his horse; 'he
has an ugly wound just where you are holding him.'</p>

<p>'Wounded! my poor boy.&nbsp; Look up.'</p>

<p>'Where is your room, sir?' said Berenger, seeing his hosts
entirely occupied with the King; and at once lifting the almost
helpless Philip like a little child in his strong arms, he followed
Sir Marmaduke, who, as if walking in his sleep, led the way up the
great stone staircase that led outside the house to the upper
chambers.</p>

<p>After a short interval, the Duchess, in the plenitude of her
glory at entertaining her dear Queen's son, came up <i>en grande
tenue</i>, leading the King by the hand, the Duke walking backwards
in front, and his two sons each holding a big wax candle on either
side.</p>

<p>'Here, Sire, is the chamber where the excellent Queen did me the
honour to repose herself.'</p>

<p>The Duke swung open the door of the state bed-chamber.&nbsp;
There on the velvet-hung bed sat <i>le gros Chevalier Anglais</i>,
whom she had herself installed there on Saturday.&nbsp; Both his
hands were held fast in those of a youth who lay beside him, deadly
pale, and half undressed, with the little Ribaumont attending to a
wound in his side, while her child was held in the arms of a very
tall, bald-headed young man, who stood at the foot of the
bed.&nbsp; The whole group of interlopers looked perfectly
glorified with happiness and delight.&nbsp; Even the wounded youth,
ghastly and suffering as he was, lay stroking the big Englishman's
hand with a languid, caressing air of content, almost like that of
a dog who has found his master.&nbsp; None of them were the least
embarrassed, they evidently thought this a visit of inquiry after
the patient; and while the Duchess stood confounded, and the Duke
much inclined to laugh, Eustacie turned eagerly, exclaiming,
'Ah!&nbsp; Madame, I am glad you are come.&nbsp; May I beg
Mademoiselle Perrot for some of your cooling mallow salve.&nbsp;
Riding has sadly inflamed the wound.'</p>

<p>'Riding--with such a wound!&nbsp; Are we all crazed?' said
Madame la Duchesse, absolutely bewildered out of her dignified
equanimity:</p>

<p>and her son, seeing her for once at a loss, came to her
rescue.&nbsp; 'His Grace will condescend to the Andromeda Chamber,
Madame.&nbsp; He kindly gave up his bed to our young friend last
night, when there was less choice than you can give him.'</p>

<p>They all moved off again; and, before Eustacie was ready for the
mallows, Madame de Quinet, for whom the very name of a wound had an
attraction, returned with two hand-maidens bearing bandages and
medicaments, having by this time come to the perception that the
wounded youth was the son of the big Englishman who had arrived
with young Mericour in search of her little <i>protegee</i>, and
that the tall man was the husband so long supposed to be
dead.&nbsp; She was curious to see her pupil's surgery, of which
she highly approved, though she had no words to express her
indignation at the folly of travelling so soon.&nbsp; Indeed,
nothing but the passiveness of fatigue could have made her
despotism endurable to Philip; but he cared for nothing so long as
he could see his father's face, and hear his voice--the full tones
that his ear had yearned for among the sharp expression of the
French accent--and Sir Marmaduke seemed to find the same perfect
satisfaction in the sight of him; indeed, all were so rejoiced to
be together, that they scarcely exerted themselves to ask
questions.&nbsp; When Berenger would have made some explanation,
Sir Marmaduke only said, 'Tell me not yet, my dear boy.&nbsp; I see
it is all right, and my head will hold no more yet but that I have
you and the lad again!&nbsp; Thank God for it!&nbsp; Never mind
how.'</p>

<p>When, however, with some difficulty they got him away from
Philip's bedside down to supper, the King came and made him high
compliments upon the distinguished bravery of his sons, and
Mericour interpreted, till Sir Marmaduke--though answering that of
course the lads must do their duty, and he was only glad to hear
they had done it--became more and more radiant and proud, as he
began to gather what their trials and what their steadfastness and
courage had been.&nbsp; His goodly face, beaming with honest
gladness, was, as Henry told the Duchess, an absolute ornament to
her table.</p>

<p>Unable, however, to converse with any one but Berenger and
Mericour, and pining all the time to get back to his son, the
lengthy and ceremonious meal was a weary penance to him; and so
soon as his release was possible, he made his way up-stairs again,
where he found Philip much refreshed by a long sleep, and only
afraid that he should find the sight of his father merely a dream;
then, when satisfied on that head, eager to hear of all at
home--</p>

<p>'the sisters, the dogs, my mother, and my little brother?' as he
arranged his inquiry.</p>

<p>'Ha! you heard of that, did you?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Philip, 'the villains gave us letters once--only
once-- and those what they thought would sting us most.&nbsp; O
father, how could you all think such foul shame of Berry?'</p>

<p>'Don't speak of it, Phil; I never did, nor Aunt Cecily, not for
a moment; but my Lord is not the man he was, and those foes of
yours must have set abroad vile reports for the very purpose of
deceiving us.&nbsp; And then this child must needs be born, poor
little rogue.&nbsp; I shall be able to take to him now all is right
again; but by St.&nbsp; George, they have tormented me so about
him, and wanted me to take him as a providence to join the estates
together, instead of you and Berry, that I never thought to care so
little for a child of my own.'</p>

<p>'We drank his health at Nid de Merle, and were not a little
comforted that you would have him in our place.'</p>

<p>'I'd rather--- Well, it skills not talking of it, but it just
shows the way of women.&nbsp; After all the outcry Dame Annora had
made about her poor son, and no one loving him or heeding his
interest save herself, no sooner was this little fellow born than
she had no thought for any but he, and would fain have had her
father settle all his lands on him, protesting that if Berry lived,
his French lands were enough for him.&nbsp; Out of sight, out of
mind, is the way with women.'</p>

<p>Womanhood was already made accountable for all Lady
Thistlewood's follies, and Philip acquiesced, asking further, 'Nay,
but how came you hither, father?&nbsp; Was it to seek us or
Eustacie?'</p>

<p>'Both, both, my lad.&nbsp; One morning just after Christmas, I
rid over to Combe with my dame behind me, and found the house in
commotion with a letter that young Sidney, Berry's friend, had just
sent down by special messenger.&nbsp; It had been writ more than a
year, but, bless you, these poor foreigners have such crooked ears
and tongues that they don't know what to make of a plain man's
name, and the only wonder was that it ever came at all.&nbsp; It
seems the Duke here had to get it sent over by some of the secret
agents the French Protestants have in England, and what do they do
but send it to one of the Vivians in Cornwall; and it was handed
about among them for how long I cannot say, till there was a chance
of sending it up to my Lord of Warwick; and he, being able to make
nothing if it, shows it to his nephew, Philip Sidney, who,
perceiving at once whom it concerned, sends it straight to my Lord,
with a handsome letter hoping that it brought good tidings.&nbsp;
There then it was, and so we first knew that the poor lady had not
been lost in the sack of the town, as Master Hobbs told us.&nbsp;
She told us how this Duchess had taken her under her protection,
but that her enemies were seeking her, and had even attempted her
child's life.'</p>

<p>'The ruffians! Even so.'</p>

<p>'And she said her old pastor was failing in health, and prayed
that some trusty person might be sent to bring home at least the
child to safety with her kindred.&nbsp; There was a letter to the
same effect, praising her highly too, from the Duchess, saying that
she would do her best to guard her, but the kinsmen had the law on
their side, and she would be safer in England.&nbsp; Well, this was
fair good news, save that we marveled the more how you and Berry
should have missed her; but the matter now was who was the trusty
person who should go.&nbsp; Claude Merrycourt was ready---'</p>

<p>'How came he there?' demanded Philip.&nbsp; 'I thought he had
gone, or been sent off with Lady Burnet's sons.'</p>

<p>'Why, so he had; but there's more to say on that score.&nbsp; He
was so much in favour at Combe, that my Lord would not be denied
his spending the holiday times there; and, besides, last summer we
had a mighty coil.&nbsp; The Horners of Mells made me a rare good
offer for Lucy for their eldest son, chiefly because they wanted a
wife for him of my Lady Walwyn's and Mistress Cecily's breeding;
and my wife was all for accepting it, having by that time given up
all hope of poor Berry.&nbsp; But I would have no commands laid on
my girl, seeing that I had pledged my word not to cross her in the
matter, and she hung about my neck and prayed me so meekly to leave
her unwedded, that I must have been made of stone not to yield to
her.&nbsp; So I told Mr. Horner that his son Jack must wait for
little Nancy if he wanted a daughter of mine--and the stripling is
young enough.&nbsp; I believe he will.&nbsp; But women's tongues
are not easy to stop, and Lucy was worn so thin, and had tears in
her eyes--that she thought I never marked--whenever she was fretted
or flouted, and at last I took her back to stay at Combe for Aunt
Cecily to cheer up a bit; and--well, well, to get rid of the matter
and silence Dame Nan, I consented to a betrothal between her and
Merrycourt--since she vowed she would rather wait single for him
than wed any one else.&nbsp; He is a good youth, and is working
himself to a shadow between studying and teaching; but as to
sending him alone to bring Berry's wife back, he was over-young for
that.&nbsp; No one could do that fitly save myself, and I only wish
I had gone three years ago, to keep you two foolish lads out of
harm's way.&nbsp; But they set up an unheard-of hubbub, and made
sure I should lose myself.&nbsp; What are you laughing at, you
Jacksauce?'</p>

<p>'To think of you starting, father, with not a word of French,
and never from home further than once to London.'</p>

<p>'Ah! you thought to come the travelled gentleman over me, but
I've been even with you.&nbsp; I made Dame Nan teach me a few
words, but I never could remember anything but that "mercy" is
"thank ye."&nbsp; However, Merrycourt offered to come with me, and
my Lord wished it.&nbsp; Moreover, I thought he might aid in
tracing you out.&nbsp; So I saw my Lord alone, and he passed his
word to me that, come what would, no one should persuade him to
alter his will to do wrong to Berenger's daughter; and so soon as
Master Hobbs could get the THROSTLE unladen, and fitted out again,
we sailed for Bordeau, and there he is waiting for us, while Clause
and I bought horses and hired a guide, and made our way here on
Saturday, where we were very welcome; and the Duchess said she
would but wait till she could learn there were no bands of the
enemy at hand, to go down with me herself to the place where she
had sent the lady.&nbsp; A right worthy dame is this same Duchess,
and a stately; and that young King, as they call him, seems hard to
please, for he told Berry that his wife's courtliness and ease in
his reception were far above aught that he found here.&nbsp; What
he means is past a plain man, for as to Berry's wife she is handy,
and notable enough, and 'tis well he loves her so well; but what a
little brown thing it is, for a man to have gone through such risks
for.&nbsp; Nothing to look at beside his mother!'</p>

<p>'If you could only see Madame de Selinville!' sighed Philip;
then--</p>

<p>'Ah! sir, you would know the worth of Eustacie had you seen her
in yonder town.'</p>

<p>'Very like!' said Sir Marmaduke; 'but after all our fears at
home of a fine court madam, it takes one aback to see a little
homely brown thing, clad like a serving wench.&nbsp; Well, Dame Nan
will not be displeased, she always said the girl would grow up no
beauty, and 'tis the way of women to brook none fairer than
themselves!&nbsp; Better so.&nbsp; She is a good Protestant, and
has done rarely by you, Phil.'</p>

<p>'Truly, I might be glad 'twas no court madam that stood by me
when Berry was called back to the fight: and for the little one,
'tis the loveliest and bravest little maid I ever saw.&nbsp; Have
they told you of the marigolds, father?'</p>

<p>'Why, the King told the whole to the Duchess, so Berry said, and
then drank the health of the daughter of the bravest of knights;
and Berry held her up in his arms to bow again, and drink to them
from his glass.&nbsp; Berry looked a proud man, I can tell you, and
a comely, spite of his baldness; and 'tis worth having come here to
see how much you lads are thought of--though to be sure 'tis not
often the poor creatures here see so much of an Englishman as we
have made of Berry.'</p>

<p>Philip could not but laugh.&nbsp; ''Tis scarce for that that
they value him, sir.'</p>

<p>'Say you so?&nbsp; Nay, methinks his English heart and yours did
them good service.&nbsp; Indeed, the King himself told me as much
by the mouth of Merrycourt.&nbsp; May that youngster's head only
not be turned!&nbsp; Why, they set him at table above Berenger, and
above half the King's gentlemen.&nbsp; Even the Duchess makes as if
he were one of her highest guests--he a poor Oxford scholar,
doubting if he can get his bread by the law, and flouted as though
he were not good enough for my daughter.&nbsp; 'Tis the world topsy
turvy, sure enough!&nbsp; And that this true love that Berenger has
run through fire and water after, like a knight in a pedlar's run
through turn out a mere little, brown, common-looking woman after
all, not one whit equal to Lucy!'</p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke modified his disappointment a little that night,
when he had talked Philip into a state of feverishness and
suffering that became worse under Madame de Quinet's reproofs and
remedies, and only yielded to Eustacie's long and patient
soothing.&nbsp; He then could almost have owned that it was well
she was not like his own cherished type of womanhood, and the next
day he changed his opinion still more, even as to her
appearance.</p>

<p>There was a great gathering of favourers of the Huguenot cause
on that day; gentlemen came from all parts to consult with Henry of
Navarre, and Madame de Quinet had too much sense of the fitness of
things to allow Madame de Ribaumont to appear at the ensuing
banquet in her shabby, rusty black serge, and tight white
borderless cap.&nbsp; The whole wardrobe of the poor young Duchess
de Quinet was placed at her service, and though, with the thought
of her adopted father on her heart, she refused gay colours, yet
when, her toilette complete, she said into Philip's room, he almost
sprang up in delight, and Sir Marmaduke rose and ceremoniously
bowed as to a stranger, and was only undeceived when little
Rayonette ran joyously to Philip, asking if <i>Manan</i> was not
<i>si belle, si belle.</i></p>

<p>The effects of her unrestful nights has now passed away, and
left her magnificent eyes in their full brilliancy and arch fire;
the blooming glow was restored to her cheek; and though neck, brow,
and hands were browner than in the shelter of convent or palace,
she was far more near absolute beauty than in former days, both
from countenance and from age.&nbsp; Her little proud head was
clustered with glossy locks of jet, still short, but curling round
her brow and neck, whose warm brunette tints contrasted well with
the delicate, stiffened cobweb of her exquisite standing ruff,
which was gathered into a white satin bodice, with a skirt of the
same material, over which swept a rich black brocade train open in
front, with an open body and half-sleeves with falling lace, and
the hands, delicate and shapely as ever, if indeed a little tanned,
held fan and handkerchief with as much courtly grace as though they
had never stirred broth nor wrung out linen.&nbsp; Sir Marmaduke
really feared he had the court madam on his hands after all, but he
forgot all about his fears, as she stood laughing and talking, and
by her pretty airs and gestures, smiles and signs, making him enter
into her mirth with Philip, almost as well as if she had not spoken
French.</p>

<p>Even Berenger started, when he came up after the counsel to
fetch her to the banqueting-hall.&nbsp; She was more entirely the
Eustacie of the Louvre than he had ever realized seeing her, and
yet so much more; and when the Duchess beheld the sensation she
produced among the <i>noblesse</i>, it was with self-congratulation
in having kept her in retirement while it was still not known that
she was not a widow.&nbsp; The King of Navarre had already found
her the only lady present possessed of the peculiar aroma of
high-breeding which belonged to the society in which both he and
she had been most at home, and his attentions were more than she
liked from one whose epithet of Eurydice she had never quite
forgiven; at least, that was the only reason she could assign for
her distaste, but the Duchess understood her better than did
Berenger, nay, better than she did herself, and kept her under the
maternal wings of double form and ceremony.</p>

<p>Berenger, meanwhile, was in great favour.&nbsp; A command had
been offered him by the King of Navarre, who had promised that if
he would cast in his lot with the Huguenots, his claims on all the
lands of Ribaumont should be enforced on the King of France when
terms were wrung from him, and Narcisse's death removed all valid
obstacle to their recognition; but Berenger felt himself bound by
all home duties to return to England, nor had he clear convictions
as to the absolute right of the war in which he had almost
unconsciously drawn his sword.&nbsp; Under the Tudors the divine
right of kings was strongly believed in, and it was with many
genuine misgivings that the cause of Protestant revolt was favoured
by Elisabeth and her ministers; and Berenger, bred up in a strong
sense of loyalty, as well as in doctrines that, as he had received
them, savoured as little of Calvinism as of Romanism, was not ready
to espouse the Huguenot cause with all his heart; and as he could
by no means have fought on the side of King Henry III. or of the
Guises, felt thankful that the knot could be cut by renouncing
France altogether, according to the arrangement which had been
defeated by the Chevalier's own supper-subtle machinations.</p>

<p>At the conference of gentlemen held at Quinet, he had been
startled by hearing the name of the Sieur de Bellaise, and had
identified him with a grave, thin, noble-looking man, with an air
of high-bred and patient poverty.&nbsp; He was a Catholic but no
Guisard, and supported the middle policy of the Montmorency party,
so far as he possessed any influence; but his was only the weight
of personal character, for he had merely a small property that had
descended to him through his grandmother, the wife of the
unfortunate Bellaise who had pined to death in the dungeon at
Loches, under Louis XI.&nbsp; Here, then, Berenger saw the right
means of riding himself and his family of the burthen that his
father had mourned over, and it only remained to convince
Eustacie.&nbsp; Her first feeling when she heard of the King's
offer, was that at last her ardent wish would be gratified, she
should see her husband at the head of her vassals, and hear the
war-cry motto <i>'A moi Ribaumont</i>.'&nbsp; Then came the old
representation that the Vendeen peasants were faithful Catholics
who could hardly be asked to fight on the Calvinist side.&nbsp; The
old spirit rose in a flush, a pout, a half-uttered query why those
creatures should be allowed their opinions.&nbsp; Madame la Baronne
was resuming her haughty temperament in the <i>noblesse</i>
atmosphere; but in the midst came the remembrance of having made
that very speech in her Temple ruin--of the grave sad look of
rebuke and shake of the head with which the good old minister had
received it--and how she had sulked at him till forced to throw
herself on him to hinder her separation from her child.&nbsp; She
burst into tears, and as Berenger, in some distress, began to
assure her that he would and could do nothing without her consent,
she struggled to recover voice to say, 'No! no! I only grieve that
I am still as wicked as ever, after these three years with that
saint, my dear father.&nbsp; Do as you will, only pardon me, the
little fierce one!'</p>

<p>And then, when she was made to perceive that her husband would
have to fight alone, and could not take her with him to share his
triumphs or bind his wounds, at least not except by bringing her in
contact with Henry of Navarre and that atmosphere of the old court,
she acquiesced the more readily.&nbsp; She was a woman who could
feel but not reason; and, though she loved Nid de Merle, and had
been proud of it, Berenger's description of the ill-used Sieur de
Bellaise had the more effect on her, because she well remembered
the traditions whispered among the peasants with whom her childhood
had been passed, that the village crones declared nothing had gone
well with the place since the Bellaise had been expelled, with a
piteous tale of the broken-hearted lady, that she had never till
now understood.</p>

<p>For the flagrant injustice perpetrated on her uncle and cousin
in the settlement on Berenger and herself she cared little,
thinking they had pretty well repaid themselves, and not entering
into Berenger's deeper view, that this injustice was the more to be
deplored as the occasion of their guilt; but she had no doubt or
question as to the grand stroke of yielding up her claims on the
estate to the Sieur de Bellaise.&nbsp; The generosity of the deed
struck her imagination, and if Berenger would not lead her vassals
to battle, she did not want them.&nbsp; There was no difficulty
with Sir Marmaduke; he only vowed that he liked Berenger's wife all
the better for being free of so many yards of French dirt tacked to
her petticoat, and Philip hated the remembrance of those red
sugar-loaf pinnacles far too much not to wish his brother to be rid
of them.</p>

<p>M. de Bellaise, when once he understood that restitution was
intended, astonished Sir Marmaduke by launching himself on
Berenger's neck with tears of joy; and Henry of Navarre, though
sorry to lose such a partisan as the young Baron, allowed that the
Bellaise claims, being those of a Catholic, might serve to keep out
some far more dangerous person whom the court party might select in
opposition to an outlaw and a Protestant like M. de Ribaumont.</p>

<p>'So you leave us,' he said in private to Berenger, to whom he
had taken a great liking.&nbsp; 'I cannot blame you for not casting
your lot into such a witch's caldron as this poor country.&nbsp; My
friends think I dallied at court like Rinaldo in Armida's
garden.&nbsp; They do not understand that when one hears the name
of Bourbon one does not willingly make war with the Crown, still
less that the good Calvin left a doctrine bitter to the taste and
tough of digestion.&nbsp; Maybe, since I have been forced to add my
spoon to stir the caldron, it may clear itself; if so, you will
remember that you have rights in Normandy and Picardy.'</p>

<p>This was the royal farewell.&nbsp; Henry and his suite departed
the next morning, but the Duchess insisted on retaining her other
guests till Philip's cure should be complete.&nbsp; Meantime,
Claude de Mericour had written to his brother and arranged a
meeting with him.&nbsp; He was now no boy who could be coerced, but
a staid, self-reliant, scholarly person, with a sword by his side
and an English passport to secure him, and his brother did not
regard him as quite the disgrace to his family he had at first
deemed him.&nbsp; He was at least no rebel; and though the law
seemed to French eyes infinitely beneath the dignity of a scion of
nobility, still it was something not to have him a heretic
preacher, and to be able at least to speak of him as betrothed to
the sister of the Baron de Ribaumont.&nbsp; Moreover, that Huguenot
kinsman, whose extreme Calvinist opinions had so nearly revolted
Mericour, had died and left him all his means, as the only
Protestant in the family; and the amount, when Claude arranged
matters with his brother, proved to be sufficient to bear him
through his expenses handsomely as a student, with the hope of
marriage so soon as he should have kept his terms at the
Temple.</p>

<p>And thus the good ship THROSTLE bore home the whole happy party
to Weymouth, and good Sir Marmaduke had an unceasing cause for
exultation in the brilliant success of his mission to France.</p>

<p>After all, the first to revisit that country was no other than
the once homesick Philip.&nbsp; He wearied of inaction, and thought
his county neighbours ineffably dull and lubberly, while they
blamed him for being a fine, Frenchified gentleman, even while
finding no fault with their old friend Berenger, or that notable
little, lively, housewifely lady his wife, whose broken English and
bright simplicity charmed every one.&nbsp; Sorely Philip needed
something to do; he might have been a gentleman pensioner, but he
had no notion, he said, of loitering after a lady to boat and hunt,
when such a king as Henry of Navarre was in the field; and he
agreed with Eustacie in her estimate of the court, that it was
horribly dull, and wanting in all the sparkle and brilliancy that
even he had perceived at Paris.</p>

<p>Eustacie gladly retreated to housewifery at Combe Walwyn, but a
strenuous endeavour on Lady Thistlewood's part to marry her stepson
to a Dorset king's daughter, together with the tidings of the
renewed war in France, spurred Philip into writing permission from
his father to join the King of Navarre as a volunteer.</p>

<p>Years went by, and Philip was only heard of in occasional
letters, accompanied by presents to his sisters and to little
Rayonette, and telling of marches, exploits, and battles,--how he
had taken a standard of the League at Coutras, and how he had led a
charge of pikemen at Ivry, for which he received the thanks of
Henry IV.&nbsp; But, though so near home, he did not set foot on
English ground till the throne of France was secured to the hero of
Navarre, and he had marched into Paris in guise very unlike the
manner he had left it.</p>

<p>Then home he came, a bronzed gallant-looking warrior, the pride
of the county, ready for repose and for aid to his father in his
hearty old age, and bearing with him a pressing invitation from the
King to Monsieur and Madame de Ribaumont to resume their rank at
court.&nbsp; Berenger, who had for many years only known himself as
Lord Walwyn, shook his head.&nbsp; 'I thank the King,' he said,
'but I am better content to breed up my children as wholly
English.&nbsp; He bade me to return when he should have stirred the
witch's caldron into clearness.&nbsp; Alas! all he has done is to
make brilliant colours shine on the vapour thereof.&nbsp; Nay,
Phil; I know your ardent love for him, and marvel not at it.&nbsp;
Before he joined the Catholic Church I trusted that he might have
given truth to the one party, and unity to the other; but when the
clergy accepted him with all his private vices, and he surrendered
unconditionally, I lost hope.&nbsp; I fear there is worse in
store.&nbsp; Queen Catherine did her most fatal work of evil when
she corrupted Henry of Navarre.'</p>

<p>'If you say more, Berry, I shall be ready to challenge you!'
said Philip.&nbsp; 'When you saw him, you little knew the true king
of souls that he is, is greatness, or his love for his
country.'</p>

<p>'Nay, I believe it; but tell me, Philip, did you not hint that
you had been among former friends--at Lucon, you said, I
think?'</p>

<p>Philip's face changed.&nbsp; 'Yes; it was for that I wished to
see you alone.&nbsp; My troop had to occupy the place.&nbsp; I had
to visit the convent to arrange for quartering my men so as least
to scandalize the sisters.&nbsp; The Abbess came to speak to
me.&nbsp; I knew her only by her eyes!&nbsp; She is changed--aged,
wan, thin with their discipline and fasts--but she once or twice
smiled as she alone in old times could smile.&nbsp; The place rings
with her devotion, her charity, her penances, and truly her face
is'--he could hardly speak--'like that of a saint.&nbsp; She knew
me at once, asked for you all, and bade me tell you that NOW she
prays for you and yours continually, and blesses you for having
opened to her the way of peace.&nbsp; Ah! Berry, I always told you
she had not her equal.'</p>

<p>'Think you so even now?'</p>

<p>'How should I not, when I have seen what repentance has made of
her?'</p>

<p>'So!' said Berenger, rather sorrowfully, 'our great Protestant
champion has still left his heart behind in a French convent.'</p>

<p>'Stay, Berenger! do you remember yonder villain conjurer's
prediction that I should wed none but a lady whose cognizance was
the leopard?'</p>

<p>'And you seem bent on accomplishing it,' said Berenger.</p>

<p>'Nay, but in another manner--that which you devised on the spur
of the moment.&nbsp; Berenger, I knew the sorcerer spake sooth when
that little moonbeam child of yours brought me the flowers from the
rampart.&nbsp; I had speech with her last night.&nbsp; She has all
the fair loveliness that belongs of right to your mother's
grandchild, but her eye, blue as it is, has the Ribaumont spirit;
the turn of the head and the smile are what I loved long ago in
yonder lady, and, above all, she is her own sweet self.&nbsp;
Berenger, give me your daughter Berangere, and I ask no portion
with her but the silver bullet.&nbsp; Keep the pearls for your
son's heirloom; all I ask with Rayonette is the silver bullet.'</p>

If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
